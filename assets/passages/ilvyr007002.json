{"id":"ilvyr007002","title":"八部罗曼史是统一的","content":["\n❶Initially the Vinaver theory that Malory‘s eight romances, once thought to be fundamentally unified, were in\nfact eight independent works produced both a sense of relief and an unpleasant shock. ❷Vinaver‘s theory\ncomfortably explained away the apparent contradictions of chronology and made each romance independently\nsatisfying. ❸It was, however, disagreeable to find that what had been thought of as one book was now eight\nbooks. ❹Part of this response was the natural reaction to the disturbance of set ideas. ❺Nevertheless, even now,\nafter lengthy consideration of the theory‘s refined but legitimate observations, one cannot avoid the conclusion\nthat the eight romances are only one work. ❻It is not quite a matter of disagreeing with the theory of\nindependence, but of rejecting its implications: that the romances may be taken in any or no particular order, that\nthey have no cumulative effect, and that they are as separate as the works of a modern novelist.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to\n","options":["discuss the validity of a hypothesis\n","summarize a system of general principles\n","propose guidelines for future argument\n","stipulate conditions for acceptance of an interpretation\n","deny accusations about an apparent contradiction\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes which of the following about Malory‘s works?\nI.\n\nThere are meaningful links between and among the romances.\n\nII.\n\nThe subtleties of the romances are obscured when they are taken as one work.\n\nIII.
