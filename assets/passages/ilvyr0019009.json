{"id":"ilvyr0019009","title":"研究文化同化的两种理论各有缺陷","content":["\n❶Discussion of the assimilation of Puerto Ricans in the United States has focused on two factors: social\nstanding and the loss of national culture. ❷In general, excessive stress is placed on one factor or the other,\ndepending on whether the commentator is North American or Puerto Rican. ❸Many North American social\nscientists, such as Oscar Handlin, Joseph Fitzpatrick, and Oscar Lewis, consider Puerto Ricans as the most recent\nin a long line of ethnic entrants to occupy the lowest rung on the social ladder. ❹Such a ―sociodemographic‖\napproach tends to regard assimilation as a benign process, taking for granted increased economic advantage and\ninevitable cultural integration, in a supposedly egalitarian context. ❺However, this approach fails to take into\naccount the colonial nature of the Puerto Rican case, with this group, unlike their European predecessors, coming\nfrom a nation politically subordinated to the United States. ❻Even the ―radical‖ critiques of this mainstream\nresearch model, such as the critique developed in Divided Society, attach the issue of ethnic assimilation too\nmechanically to factors of economic and social mobility and are thus unable to illuminate the cultural\nsubordination of Puerto Ricans as a colonial minority.","❶In contrast, the ―colonialist‖ approach of island-based writers such as Eduardo Seda-Bonilla, Manuel\nMaldonado-Denis, and Luis Nieves-Falcon tends to view assimilation as the forced loss of national culture in an\nunequal contest with imposed foreign values. ❷There is, of course, a strong tradition of cultural accommodation\namong other Puerto Rican thinkers. ❸The writings of Eugenio Fernandez Mendez clearly exemplify this\ntradition, and many supporters of Puerto Rico‘s commonwealth status share the same universalizing orientation.\n❹But the Puerto Rican intellectuals who have written most about the assimilation process in the United States\nall advance cultural nationalist views, advocating the preservation of minority cultural distinctions and rejecting\nwhat they see as the subjugation of colonial nationalities.","❶This cultural and political emphasis is appropriate, but the colonialist thinkers misdirect it, overlooking the\nclass relations at work in both Puerto Rican and North American history. ❷They pose the clash of national\ncultures as an absolute polarity, with each culture understood as static and undifferentiated. ❸Yet both the\nPuerto Rican and North American traditions have been subject to constant challenge from cultural forces within\ntheir own societies, forces that may move toward each other in ways that cannot be written off as mere\n―assimilation.‖ ❹Consider, for example, the indigenous and Afro-Caribbean traditions in Puerto Rican\nculture and how they influence and are influenced by other Caribbean cultures and Black cultures in the\nUnited States. ❺The elements of coercion and inequality, so central to cultural contact according to the\ncolonialist framework play no role in this kind of convergence of racially and ethnically different elements of the\nsame social class.","\f21.
