{"title":"女性雕塑家Nevelson的作品创作理念与创作特色","passage":"27\n(This passage is from a book published in 1975.)\n❶That Louise Nevelson is believed by many critics to be the greatest twentieth-century sculptor is all the more\nremarkable because the greatest resistance to women artists has been, until recently, in the field of sculpture.\n❷Since Neolithic times, sculpture has been considered the prerogative of men, partly, perhaps, for purely\nphysical reasons: it was erroneously assumed that women were not suited for the hard manual labor required in\nsculpting stone, carving wood, or working in metal. ❸It has been only during the twentieth century that women\nsculptors have been recognized as major artists, and it has been in the United States, especially since the decades\nof the fifties and sixties, that women sculptors have shown the greatest originality and creative power. ❹Their\nrise to prominence parallels the development of sculpture itself in the United States: while there had been a few\ntalented sculptors in the United States before the 1940‘s, it was only after 1945—when New York was rapidly\nbecoming the art capital of the world—that major sculpture was produced in the United States. ❺ Some of the\nbest was the work of women.\n\n❶By far the most outstanding of these women is Louise Nevelson, who in the eyes of many critics is the most\noriginal female artist alive today. ❷One famous and influential critic, Hilton Kramer, said of her work,\n“For myself, I think Ms. Nevelson succeeds where the painters often fail.”\n\n❶Her works have been compared to the Cubist constructions of Picasso, the Surrealistic objects of Miro, and\nthe Merzbau of Schwitters. ❷Nevelson would be the first to admit that she has been influenced by all of\nthese, as well as by African sculpture, and by Native American and pre-Columbian art, but she has\nabsorbed all these influences and still created a distinctive art that expresses the urban landscape and the\naesthetic sensibility of the twentieth century. ❸Nevelson says, ―I have always wanted to show the world that\nart is everywhere, except that it has to pass through a creative mind.‖\n\n❶Using mostly discarded wooden objects like packing crates, broken pieces of furniture, and abandoned\narchitectural ornaments, all of which she has hoarded for years, she assembles architectural constructions of\ngreat beauty and power. ❷Creating very freely with no sketches, she glues and nails objects together, paints\nthem black, or more rarely white or gold, and places them in boxes. ❸These assemblages, walls, even entire\nenvironments create a mysterious, almost awe-inspiring atmosphere. ❹Although she has denied any symbolic\nor religious intent in her works, their three-dimensional grandeur and even their titles, such as Sky Cathedral and\nNight Cathedral, suggest such connotations. ❺In some ways, her most ambitious works are closer to\narchitecture than to traditional sculpture, but then neither Louise Nevelson nor her art fits into any neat category.\n\n\f17.
