{"title":"雌蕊的形态特征可以减少植物花粉浪费","passage":"28\n❶Traditionally, pollination by wind has been viewed as a reproductive process marked by random events in\nwhich the vagaries of the wind are compensated for by the generation of vast quantities of pollen, so that the\nultimate production of new seeds is assured at the expense of producing much more pollen than is actually used.\n❷Because the potential hazards pollen grains are subject to as they are transported over long distances are\nenormous, wind-pollinated plants have, in the view above, compensated for the ensuing loss of pollen through\nhappenstance by virtue of producing an amount of pollen that is one to three orders of magnitude greater than the\namount produced by species pollinated by insects.\n\n❶However, a number of features that are characteristic of wind-pollinated plants reduce pollen waste. ❷For\nexample, many wind-pollinated species fail to release pollen when wind speeds are low or when humid\nconditions prevail. ❸Recent studies suggest another way in which species compensate for the inefficiency of\nwind pollination. ❹These studies suggest that species frequently take advantage of the physics of pollen motion\nby generating specific aerodynamic environments within the immediate vicinity of their female reproductive\norgans. ❺It is the morphology of these organs that dictates the pattern of airflow disturbances through which\npollen must travel. ❻The speed and direction of the airflow disturbances can combine with the physical\nproperties of a species‘ pollen to produce a species-specific pattern of pollen collision on the surfaces of female\nreproductive organs. ❼Provided that these surfaces are strategically located, the consequences of this\ncombination can significantly increase the pollen-capture efficiency of a female reproductive organ.\n❶A critical question that remains to be answered is whether the morphological attributes of the female\nreproductive organs of wind-pollinated species are evolutionary adaptations to wind pollination or are merely\nfortuitous. ❷A complete resolution of the question is as yet impossible since adaptation must be evaluated for\neach species within its own unique functional context. ❸However, it must be said that, while evidence of such\nevolutionary adaptations does exist in some species, one must be careful about attributing morphology to\nadaptation. ❹For example, the spiral arrangement of scale-bract complexes on ovule-bearing pine cones, where\nthe female reproductive organs of conifers are located, is important to the production of airflow patterns that\nspiral over the cone‘s surfaces, thereby passing airborne pollen from one scale to the next. ❺However, these\npatterns cannot be viewed as an adaptation to wind pollination because the spiral arrangement occurs in a\nnumber of non-wind-pollinated plant lineages and is regarded as a characteristic of vascular plants, of which\nconifers are only one kind, as a whole. ❻Therefore, the spiral arrangement is not likely to be the result of a\ndirect adaptation to wind pollination.\n\n\f21.
