{"title":"物种数量变化由种群密度和与种群密度无关的因素共同调节","passage":"29\n❶As Gilbert White, Darwin, and others observed long ago, all species appear to have the innate capacity to\nincrease their numbers from generation to generation. ❷The task for ecologists is to untangle the environmental\nand biological factors that hold this intrinsic capacity for population growth in check over the long run. ❸The\ngreat variety of dynamic behaviors exhibited by different populations makes this task more difficult: some\npopulations remain roughly constant from year to year; others exhibit regular cycles of abundance and scarcity;\nstill others vary wildly, with outbreaks and crashes that are in some cases plainly correlated with the weather,\nand in other cases not.\n\n❶To impose some order on this kaleidoscope of patterns, one school of thought proposes dividing populations\ninto two groups. ❷These ecologists posit that the relatively steady populations have ―density-dependent‖\ngrowth parameters; that is, rates of birth, death, and migration which depend strongly on population density.\n❸The highly varying populations have ―density-independent‖ growth parameters, with vital rates buffeted by\nenvironmental events; these rates fluctuate in a way that is wholly independent of population density.\n\n❶This dichotomy has its uses, but it can cause problems if taken too literally. ❷For one thing, no population\ncan be driven entirely by density-independent factors all the time. ❸No matter how severely or unpredictably\nbirth, death and migration rates may be fluctuating around their long-term averages, if there were no\ndensity-dependent effects, the population would, in the long run, either increase or decrease without bound\n(barring a miracle by which gains and losses canceled exactly). ❹Put another way, it may be that on average 99\npercent of all deaths in a population arise from density-independent causes, and only one percent from factors\nvarying with density. ❺The factors making up the one percent may seem unimportant, and their cause may be\ncorrespondingly hard to determine. ❻Yet, whether recognized or not, they will usually determine the long-term\naverage population density.\n\n❶In order to understand the nature of the ecologist‘s investigation, we may think of the density-dependent\neffects on growth parameters as the ―signal‖ ecologists are trying to isolate and interpret, one that tends to make\nthe population increase from relatively low values or decrease from relatively high ones, while the\ndensity-independent effects act to produce ―noise‖ in the population dynamics. ❷For populations that remain\nrelatively constant, or that oscillate around repeated cycles, the signal can be fairly easily characterized and its\neffects described, even though the causative biological mechanism may remain unknown. ❸For irregularly\nfluctuating populations, we are likely to have too few observations to have any hope of extracting the signal from\nthe overwhelming noise. ❹But it now seems clear that all populations are regulated by a mixture of\ndensity-dependent and density-independent effects in varying proportions.\n\n\f17.
