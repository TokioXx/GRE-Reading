{"title":"介绍了学者对女权主义研究的不足","passage":"36\n❶Students of United States history, seeking to identify the circumstances that encouraged the emergence\nof feminist movements, have thoroughly investigated the mid-nineteenth-century American economic and social\nconditions that affected the status of women. ❷These historians, however, have analyzed less fully the\ndevelopment of specifically feminist ideas and activities during the same period. ❸Furthermore, the ideological\norigins of feminism in the United States have been obscured because, even when historians did take into account\nthose feminist ideas and activities occurring within the United States, they failed to recognize that feminism was\nthen a truly international movement actually centered in Europe. ❹American feminist activists who have been\ndescribed as ―solitary‖ and ―individual theorists‖ were in reality connected to a movement—utopian\nsocialism—which was already popularizing feminist ideas in Europe during the two decades that culminated in\nthe first women‘s rights conference held at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. ❺Thus, a complete understanding\nof the origins and development of nineteenth-century feminism in the United States requires that the\ngeographical focus be widened to include Europe and that the detailed study already made of social conditions\nbe expanded to include the ideological development of feminism.\n❶The earliest and most popular of the utopian socialists were the Saint-Simonians. ❷The specifically\nfeminist part of Saint-Simonianism has, however, been less studied than the group‘s contribution to early\nsocialism. ❸This is regrettable on two counts. ❹By 1832 feminism was the central concern of\nSaint-Simonianism and entirely absorbed its adherents‘ energy; hence, by ignoring its feminism, European\nhistorians have misunderstood Saint-Simonianism. ❺Moreover, since many feminist ideas can be traced to\nSaint-Simonianism, European historians‘ appreciation of later feminism in France and the United States\nremained limited.\n❶Saint-Simon‘s followers, many of whom were women, based their feminism on an interpretation of his\nproject to reorganize the globe by replacing brute force with the rule of spiritual powers. ❷The new world order\nwould be ruled together by a male, to represent reflection, and a female, to represent sentiment. ❸This\ncomplementarity reflects the fact that, while the Saint-Simonians did not reject the belief that there were innate\ndifferences between men and women, they nevertheless foresaw an equally important social and political role for\nboth sexes in their utopia.\n❶Only a few Saint-Simonians opposed a definition of sexual equality based on gender distinction. ❷This\nminority believed that individuals of both sexes were born similar in capacity and character, and they ascribed\nmale-female differences to socialization and education. ❸The envisioned result of both currents of thought,\nhowever, was that women would enter public life in the new age and that sexual equality would reward men as\nwell as women with an improved way of life.\n\n\f21.
