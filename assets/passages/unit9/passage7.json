{"title":"人类关系通过常识容易理解，但是对其科学性研究少","passage":"3\n❶Human relations have commanded people‘s attention from early times. ❷The ways of people have been\nrecorded in innumerable myths, folktales, novels, poems, plays, and popular or philosophical essays.\n❸Although the full significance of a human relationship may not be directly evident, the complexity of feelings\nand actions that can be understood at a glance is surprisingly great. ❹For this reason psychology holds a\nunique position among the sciences. ❺―Intuitive‖ knowledge may be remarkably penetrating and can\nsignificantly help us understand human behavior, whereas in the physical sciences such commonsense\nknowledge is relatively primitive. ❻If we erased all knowledge of scientific physics from our modern world,\nnot only would we not have cars and television sets, we might even find that the ordinary person was unable to\ncope with the fundamental mechanical problems of pulleys and levers. ❼On the other hand if we removed all\nknowledge of scientific psychology from our world, problems in interpersonal relations might easily be coped\nwith and solved much as before. ❽We would still ―know‖ how to avoid doing something asked of us and how\nto get someone to agree with us; we would still ―know‖ when someone was angry and when someone was\npleased. ❾One could even offer sensible explanations for the ―whys‖ of much of the self‘s behavior and\nfeelings. ❿In other words, the ordinary person has a great and profound understanding of the self and of other\npeople which, though unformulated or only vaguely conceived, enables one to interact with others in more or\nless adaptive ways. 11\n○ Kohler, in referring to the lack of great discoveries in psychology as compared with\nphysics, accounts for this by saying that ―people were acquainted with practically all territories of mental life a\nlong time before the founding of scientific psychology.‖\n❶Paradoxically, with all this natural, intuitive, commonsense capacity to grasp human relations, the science of\nhuman relations has been one of the last to develop. ❷Different explanations of this paradox have been\nsuggested. ❸One is that science would destroy the vain and pleasing illusions people have about themselves;\nbut we might ask why people have always loved to read pessimistic, debunking writings, from Ecclesiastes to\nFreud. ❹It has also been proposed that just because we know so much about people intuitively, there has been\nless incentive for studying them scientifically; why should one develop a theory, carry out systematic\nobservations, or make predictions about the obvious? ❺In any case, the field of human relations, with its vast\nliterary documentation but meager scientific treatment, is in great contrast to the field of physic in which there\nare relatively few nonscientific books.\n\n\f21.
