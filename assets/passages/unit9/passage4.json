{"title":"皮肤灭菌的机理","passage":"0\n❶Although pathogenic organisms constantly alight on the skin, they find it a very unfavorable environment and,\nin the absence of injury, have great difficulty colonizing it. ❷This ―self-sterilizing‖ capacity of the skin results\nfrom the tendency of all well-developed ecosystems toward homeostasis, or the maintenance of the status quo.\n\n❶Species that typically live in soil, water, and elsewhere rarely multiply on the skin. ❷Undamaged skin is also\nunfavorable to most human pathogens. ❸The skin is too acid and too arid for some species. ❹The constant\nshedding of the surface skin layers further hinders the establishment of invaders. ❺The most interesting defense\nmechanism, however, results from the metabolic activities of the resident flora. ❻Unsaturated fatty acids, an\nimportant component of the lipids in sebum collected from the skin surface, inhibit the growth of several\nbacterial and fungal cutaneous pathogens. ❼These acids are a metabolic product of certain gram-positive\nmembers of the cutaneous community, which break down the more complex lipids in freshly secreted sebum.\n","questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to\n","options":["offer an analysis of metabolic processes\n","detail the ways in which bacteria and fungi can be inhibited\n","describe mechanisms by which the skin protects itself against pathogens\n","analyze the methods whereby biological systems maintain the status quo\n","provide a specific example of the skin‘s basic defenses against pathogens\n"]},{"subject":" The ―resident flora‖ mentioned in the highlighted portion refer to\n","options":["―Unsaturated fatty acids‖ (in the highlighted portion)\n","―sebum collected from the skin surface‖ (in the highlighted portion)\n","―bacterial and fungal cutaneous pathogens‖ (in the highlighted portion)\n","―certain gram-positive members of the cutaneous community‖ (in the highlighted portion)\n","―more complex lipids‖ (lines 23)\n"]},{"subject":" Among the natural defenses of the skin against pathogenic organisms are all of the following EXCEPT the\n","options":["dryness of the skin\n","acidity of the skin\n","tendency of the pathogens toward homeostasis\n","shedding of surface layers of the skin\n","metabolic breakdown of lipids\n"]},{"subject":" The author presents her material in which of the following ways?\n","options":["Stating a problem and then supplying a solution\n","Presenting a phenomenon and then analyzing reason for it\n","Providing information and then drawing a conclusion from it\n","Making a general statement and then arguing by analogy\n","Making an inference and then developing it by illustration\n\n\f"]}]}
