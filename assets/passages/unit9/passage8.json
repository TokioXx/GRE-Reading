{"title":"从墨西哥裔美国人的经历来分析墨西哥文化","passage":"4\n❶Traditional research has confronted only Mexican and United States interpretations of Mexican-American\nculture. ❷Now we must also examine the culture as we Mexican Americans have experienced it, passing from a\nsovereign people to compatriots with newly arriving settlers to, finally, a conquered people—a charter (a grant\nor guarantee of rights, franchises, or privileges from the sovereign power of a state or country) minority\non our own land.\n❶When the Spanish first came to Mexico, they intermarried with and absorbed the culture of the indigenous\nIndians. ❷This policy of colonization through acculturation was continued when Mexico acquired Texas in the\nearly 1800‘s and brought the indigenous Indians into Mexican life and government. ❸In the 1820‘s, United\nStates citizens migrated to Texas, attracted by land suitable for cotton. ❹As their numbers became more\nsubstantial, their policy of acquiring land by subduing native populations began to dominate. ❺The two\nideologies clashed repeatedly, culminating in a military conflict that led to victory for the United States. ❻Thus,\nsuddenly deprived of our parent culture, we had to evolve uniquely Mexican-American modes of thought and\naction in order to survive.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author‘s purpose in writing this passage is primarily to\n","options":["suggest the motives behind Mexican and United States intervention in Texas\n","document certain early objectives of Mexican-American society\n","provide a historical perspective for a new analysis of Mexican-American culture\n","appeal to both Mexican and United States scholars to give greater consideration to economic\ninterpretations of history\n","bring to light previously overlooked research on Mexican Americans\n"]},{"subject":" The author most probably uses the phrase ―charter minority‖ (in the highlighted portion) to reinforce the\nidea that Mexican Americans\n","options":["are a native rather than an immigrant group in the United States\n","played an active political role when Texas first became part of the United States\n","recognized very early in the nineteenth century the need for official confirmation of their rights of\ncitizenship\n","have been misunderstood by scholars trying to interpret their culture\n","identify more closely with their Indian heritage than with their Spanish heritage\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, a major difference between the colonization policy of the United States and that of\nMexico in Texas in the 1800‘s was the\n","options":["degree to which policies were based on tradition\n","form of economic interdependency between different cultural groups\n","number of people who came to settle new areas\n","treatment of the native inhabitants\n","relationship between the military and the settlers\n\n\f20.
