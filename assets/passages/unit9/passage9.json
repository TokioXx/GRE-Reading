{"title":"Coltran对爵士乐所做出的音乐探索以及影响","passage":"5\n❶Proponents of different jazz styles have always argued that their predecessors‘ musical style did not include\nessential characteristics that define jazz as jazz. ❷Thus, 1940‘s swing was belittled by beboppers of the 1950‘s,\nwho were themselves attacked by free jazzers of the 1960‘s. ❸The neoboppers of the 1980‘s and 1990‘s\nattacked almost everybody else. ❹The titanic figure of Black saxophonist John Coltrane has complicated the\narguments made by proponents of styles from bebop through neobop because in his own musical journey he\ndrew from all those styles. ❺His influence on all types of jazz was immeasurable. ❻At the height of his\npopularity, Coltrane largely abandoned playing bebop, the style that had brought him fame, to explore the outer\nreaches of jazz.\n\n❶Coltrane himself probably believed that the only essential characteristic of jazz was improvisation, the one\nconstant in his journey from bebop to open-ended improvisations on modal, Indian, and African melodies. ❷On\nthe other hand, this dogged student and prodigious technician—who insisted on spending hours each day\npracticing scales from theory books—was never able to jettison completely the influence of bebop, with its fast\nand elaborate chains of notes and ornaments on melody.\n\n❶Two stylistic characteristics shaped the way Coltrane played the tenor saxophone, he favored playing fast runs\nof notes built on a melody and depended on heavy, regularly accented beats. ❷The first led Coltrane to ―sheets\nof sound‖ where he raced faster and faster, pile-driving notes into each other to suggest stacked harmonies.\n❸The second meant that his sense of rhythm was almost as close to rock as to bebop.\n\n❶Three recordings illustrate Coltrane‘s energizing explorations. ❷Recording Kind of Blue with Miles Davis,\nColtrane found himself outside bop, exploring modal melodies. ❸Here he played surging, lengthy solos built\nlargely around repeated motifs—an organizing principle unlike that of free jazz saxophone player Ornette\nColeman, who modulated or altered melodies in his solos. ❹On Giant Steps, Coltrane debuted as leader,\nintroducing his own compositions. ❺Here the sheets of sound, downbeat accents, repetitions, and great speed\nare part of each solo, and the variety of the shapes of his phrases is unique. ❻Coltrane‘s searching explorations\nproduced solid achievement. ❼My Favorite Things was another kind of watershed. ❽Here Coltrane played the\nsoprano saxophone, an instrument seldom used by jazz musicians. ❾Musically, the results were astounding. ❿\nWith the soprano‘s piping sound, ideas that had sounded dark and brooding acquired a feeling of giddy fantasy.\n\n❶When Coltrane began recording for the Impulse! Label, he was still searching. ❷His music became raucous,\nphysical. ❸His influence on rockers was enormous, including Jimi Hendrix, the rock guitarist, who, following\nColtrane, raised the extended guitar solo using repeated motifs to a kind of rock art form.\n\n\f21.
