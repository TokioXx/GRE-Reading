{"title":"Verdi使歌剧变成了高雅艺术","passage":"1\n❶ ―Popular art‖ has a number of meanings, impossible to define with any precision, which range from\nfolklore to junk. ❷The poles are clear enough, but the middle tends to blur. ❸The Hollywood Western of the\n1930‘s, for example, has elements of folklore, but is closer to junk than to high art or folk art. ❹There can be\ngreat trash, just as there is bad high art. ❺The musicals of George Gershwin are great popular art, never aspiring\nto high art. ❻Schubert and Brahms, however, used elements of popular music—folk themes—in works clearly\nintended as high art. ❼The case of Verdi is a different one: he took a popular genre—bourgeois melodrama set\nto music (an accurate definition of nineteenth-century opera)—and, without altering its fundamental nature,\ntransmuted it into high art. ❽This remains one of the greatest achievements in music, and one that cannot be\nfully appreciated without recognizing the essential trashiness of the genre.\n❶As an example of such a transmutation, consider what Verdi made of the typical political elements of\nnineteenth-century opera. ❷Generally in the plots of these operas, a hero or heroine—usually portrayed only as\nan individual, unfettered by class—is caught between the immoral corruption of the aristocracy and the\ndoctrinaire rigidity or secret greed of the leaders of the proletariat. ❸Verdi transforms this naive and unlikely\nformulation with music of extraordinary energy and rhythmic vitality, music more subtle than it seems at first\nhearing. ❹There are scenes and arias that still sound like calls to arms and were clearly understood as such\nwhen they were first performed. ❺Such pieces lend an immediacy to the otherwise veiled political message of\nthese operas and call up feelings beyond those of the opera itself.\n❶Or consider Verdi‘s treatment of character. ❷Before Verdi, there were rarely any characters at all in\nmusical drama, only a series of situations which allowed the singers to express a series of emotional states.\n❸Any attempt to find coherent psychological portrayal in these operas is misplaced ingenuity. ❹The only\ncoherence was the singer‘s vocal technique: when the cast changed, new arias were almost always substituted,\ngenerally adapted from other operas. ❺Verdi‘s characters, on the other hand, have genuine consistency and\nintegrity, even if, in many cases, the consistency is that of pasteboard melodrama. ❻The integrity of the\ncharacter is achieved through the music: once he had become established, Verdi did not rewrite his music for\ndifferent singers or countenance alterations or substitutions of somebody else‘s arias in one of his operas, as\nevery eighteenth-century composer had done. ❼When he revised an opera, it was only for dramatic economy\nand effectiveness.\n\n\f21.
