{"title":"大脑过程和精神体验的关系的研究令人沮丧","passage":"70\n❶By 1950, the results of attempts to relate brain processes to mental experience appeared rather discouraging.\n❷Such variations in size, shape, chemistry, conduction speed, excitation threshold, and the like as had been\ndemonstrated in nerve cells remained negligible in significance for any possible correlation with the manifold\ndimensions of mental experience.\n\n❶Near the turn of the century, it had been suggested by Hering that different modes of sensation, such as pain,\ntaste, and color, might be correlated with the discharge of specific kinds of nervous energy. ❷However,\nsubsequently developed methods of recording and analyzing nerve potentials failed to reveal any such qualitative\ndiversity. ❸It was possible to demonstrate by other methods refined structural differences among neuron types;\nhowever, proof was lacking that the quality of the impulse or its condition was influenced by these differences,\nwhich seemed instead to influence the developmental patterning of the neural circuits. ❹Although qualitative\nvariance among nerve energies was never rigidly disproved, the doctrine was generally abandoned in favor of the\nopposing view, namely, that nerve impulses are essentially homogeneous in quality and are transmitted as\n―common currency‖ throughout the nervous system. ❺According to this theory, it is not the quality of the\nsensory nerve impulses that determines the diverse conscious sensations they produce, but rather the different\nareas of the brain into which they discharge, and there is some evidence for this view. ❻In one experiment,\nwhen an electric stimulus was applied to a given sensory field of the cerebral cortex of a conscious human\nsubject, it produced a sensation of the appropriate modality for that particular locus, that is, a visual\nsensation from the visual cortex, an auditory sensation from the auditory cortex, and so on. ❼Other\nexperiments revealed slight variations in the size, number, arrangement, and interconnection of the nerve cells,\nbut as far as psychoneural correlations were concerned, the obvious similarities of these sensory fields to each\nother seemed much more remarkable than any of the minute differences.\n\n❶However, cortical locus, in itself, turned out to have little explanatory value. ❷Studies showed that\nsensations as diverse as those of red, black, green, and white, or touch, cold, warmth, movement, pain, posture,\nand pressure apparently may arise through activation of the same cortical areas. ❸What seemed to remain was\nsome kind of differential patterning effects in the brain excitation: it is the difference in the central distribution of\nimpulses that counts. ❹In short, brain theory suggested a correlation between mental experience and the activity\nof relatively homogeneous nerve-cell units conducting essentially homogeneous impulses through homogeneous\ncerebral tissue. ❺To match the multiple dimensions of mental experience psychologists could only point to a\nlimitless variation in the spatiotemporal patterning of nerve impulses.\n\n\f21.
