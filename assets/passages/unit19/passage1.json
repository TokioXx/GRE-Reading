{"title":"作者通过指出对权力的错误解读，给出自己对于权力的理解","passage":"67\n❶It seems to me that power must be understood as the multiplicity of force relations that are immanent in\nthe social sphere; as the process that, through ceaseless struggle and confrontation, transforms, strengthens, or\nreverses them; as the support that these force relations find in one another, or on the contrary, the disjunctions\nand contradictions that isolate them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect,\nwhose general design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of the\nlaw, in the various social hegemonies.\n❶Thus, the viewpoint that permits one to understand the exercise of power, even in its more ―peripheral‖\neffects, and that also makes it possible to use its mechanisms as a structural framework for analyzing the social\norder, must not be sought in a unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and descendent forms of\npower emanate but in the moving substrate of force relations that, by virtue of their inequality, constantly\nengender local and unstable states of power. ❷If power seems omnipresent, it is not because it has the privilege\nof consolidating everything under its invincible unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the next, at\nevery point, or rather in every relation from one point to another. ❸Power is everywhere, not because it\nembraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. ❹And if power at times seems to be permanent,\nrepetitious, inert, and self-reproducing, it is simply because the overall effect that emerges from all these\nmobilities is a concatenation that rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their movement. ❺One needs\nto be nominalist, no doubt: power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are\nendowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategic situation in a particular society.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author‘s primary purpose in defining power is to\n","options":["counteract self-serving and confusing uses of the term\n","establish a compromise among those who have defined the term in different ways\n","increase comprehension of the term by providing concrete examples\n","demonstrate how the meaning of the term has evolved\n","avoid possible misinterpretations resulting from the more common uses of the term\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, which of the following best describes the relationship between law and power?\n","options":["Law is the protector of power.\n","Law is the source of power.\n","Law sets bounds to power.\n","Law is a product of power.\n","Law is a stabilizer of power.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following methods is NOT used extensively by the author in describing his own conception of\npower?\n","options":["Restatement of central ideas\n","Provision of concrete examples\n","Analysis and classification\n\n\f(D) Comparison and contrast\n","Statement of cause and effect\n"]},{"subject":" With which of the following statement would the author be most likely to agree?\n","options":["Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n","The highest proof of virtue is to possess boundless power without abusing it.\n","To love knowledge is to love power.\n","It is from the people and their deeds that power springs.\n","The health of the people as a state is the foundation on which all their power depends.\n"]},{"subject":" The author‘s attitude toward the various kinds of compulsion employed by social institutions is best\ndescribed as\n","options":["concerned and sympathetic\n","scientific and detached\n","suspicious and cautious\n","reproachful and disturbed\n","meditative and wistful\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, states of power are transient because of the\n","options":["differing natures and directions of the forces that create them\n","rigid structural framework in which they operate\n","unique source from which they emanate\n","pervasive nature and complexity of the mechanisms by which they operate\n","concatenation that seeks to arrest their movement\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes the conflict among social forces to be\n","options":["essentially the same from one society to another even though its outward manifestation may seem\ndifferent\n","usually the result of misunderstandings that impede social progress\n","an inevitable feature of the social order of any state\n","wrongly blamed for disrupting the stability of society\n","best moderated in states that possess a strong central government\n\n\f"]}]}
