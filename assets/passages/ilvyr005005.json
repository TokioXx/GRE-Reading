{"id":"ilvyr005005","title":"国际市场变化导致农民不满","content":["\n❶The historian Frederick J. Turner wrote in the 1890‘s that the agrarian discontent that had been developing\nsteadily in the United States since about 1870 had been precipitated by the closing of the internal frontier—that\nis, the depletion of available new land needed for further expansion of the American farming system. ❷Not only\nwas Turner‘s thesis influential at the time, it was later adopted and elaborated by other scholars, such as John D.\nHicks in The Populist Revolt (1931). ❸Actually, however, new lands were taken up for farming in the\nUnited States throughout and beyond the nineteenth century. ❹In the 1890‘s, when agrarian discontent had\nbecome most acute, 1,100,000 new farms were settled, which was 500,000 more than had been settled during the\nprevious decade. ❺After 1890, under the terms of the Homestead Act and its successors, more new land was\ntaken up for farming than had been taken up for this purpose in the United States up until that time. ❻It is true\nthat a high proportion of the newly farmed land was suitable only for grazing and dry farming, but agricultural\npractices had become sufficiently advanced to make it possible to increase the profitability of farming by\nutilizing even these relatively barren lands.","❶The emphasis given by both scholars and statesmen to the presumed disappearance of the American frontier\nhelped to obscure the great importance of changes in the conditions and consequences of international trade that\noccurred during the second half of the nineteenth century. ❷In 1869 the Suez Canal was opened and the first\ntranscontinental railroad in the United States was completed. ❸An extensive network of telegraph and\ntelephone communications was spun: Europe was connected by submarine cable with the United States in 1866\nand with South America in 1874. ❹By about 1870 improvements in agricultural technology made possible the\nfull exploitation of areas that were most suitable for extensive farming on a mechanized basis. ❺Huge tracts of\nland were being settled and farmed in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and in the American West, and these areas\nwere joined with one another and with the countries of Europe into an interdependent market system. ❻As a\nconsequence, agrarian depressions no longer were local or national in scope, and they struck several nations\nwhose internal frontiers had not vanished or were not about to vanish. ❼Between the early 1870‘s and the\n1890‘s, the mounting agrarian discontent in America paralleled the almost uninterrupted decline in the prices of\nAmerican agricultural products on foreign markets. ❽Those staple-growing farmers in the United States who\nexhibited the greatest discontent were those who had become most dependent on foreign markets for the sale of\ntheir products. ❾Insofar as Americans had been deterred from taking up new land for farming, it was because\nmarket conditions had made this period a perilous time in which to do so.","\f20.
