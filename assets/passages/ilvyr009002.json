{"id":"ilvyr009002","title":"为什么英国人移民，以及什么人移民","content":["\n❶In a recent study, David Cressy examines two central questions concerning English immigration to New\nEngland in the 1630‘s: what kinds of people immigrated and why? ❷Using contemporary literary evidence,\nshipping lists, and customs records, Cressy finds that most adult immigrants were skilled in farming or crafts,\nwere literate, and were organized in families. ❸Each of these characteristics sharply distinguishes the 21,000\npeople who left for New England in the 1630‘s from most of the approximately 377,000 English people who had\nimmigrating to America by 1700.\n❶With respect to their reasons for immigrating, Cressy does not deny the frequently noted fact that some of the\nimmigrants of the 1630‘s, most notably the organizers and clergy, advanced religious explanations for departure,\nbut he finds that such explanations usually assumed primacy only in retrospect. ❷When he moves beyond the\nprincipal actors, he finds that religious explanations were less frequently offered and he concludes that most\npeople immigrated because they were recruited by promises of material improvement."],"questions":[{"subject":" In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with\n","options":["summarizing the findings of an investigation\n","analyzing a method of argument\n","evaluating a point of view\n","hypothesizing about a set of circumstances\n","establishing categories\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, Cressy would agree with which of the following statements about the organizers\namong the English immigrants to New England in the 1630‘s?\nI.\n\nMost of them were clergy.\n\nII.\n\nSome of them offered a religious explanation for their immigration.\n\nIII.
