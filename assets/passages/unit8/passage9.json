{"title":"评论Mary","passage":"5\n❶Mary Barton, particularly in its early chapters, is a moving response to the suffering of the industrial worker\nin the England of the 1840‘s. ❷What is most impressive about the book is the intense and painstaking effort\nmade by the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, to convey the experience of everyday life in working-class homes. ❸Her\nmethod is partly documentary in nature: the novel includes such features as a carefully annotated reproduction of\ndialect, the exact details of food prices in an account of a tea party, an itemized description of the furniture of the\nBarton‘ s living room, and a transcription (again annotated) of the ballad ―The Oldham Weaver.‖ ❹The interest\nof this record is considerable, even though the method has a slightly distancing effect.\n❶As a member of the middle class, Gaskell could hardly help approaching working-class life as an outside\nobserver and a reporter, and the reader of the novel is always conscious of this fact. ❷But there is genuine\nimaginative re-creation in her accounts of the walk in Green Heys Fields, of tea at the Bartons‘ house, and of\nJohn Barton and his friend‘s discovery of the starving family in the cellar in the chapter ―Poverty and Death.‖\n❸Indeed, for a similarly convincing re-creation of such families‘ emotions and responses (which are more\ncrucial than the material details on which the mere reporter is apt to concentrate), the English novel had to wait\n60 years for the early writing of D. H. Lawrence. ❹Even if Gaskell never quite conveys the sense of full\nparticipation that would completely authenticate this aspect of Mary Barton, she still brings to these scenes an\nintuitive recognition of feelings that has its own sufficient conviction.\n❶The chapter ―Old Alice‘s History‖ brilliantly dramatizes the situation of that early generation of workers\nbrought from the villages and the countryside to the urban industrial centers. ❷The account of Job Legh, the\nweaver and naturalist who is devoted to the study of biology, vividly embodies one kind of response to an urban\nindustrial environment: an affinity for living things that hardens, by its very contrast with its environment, into a\nkind of crankiness. ❸The early chapters—about factory workers walking out in spring into Green Heys Fields;\nabout Alice Wilson, remembering in her cellar the twig-gathering for brooms in the native village that she will\nnever again see; about Job Legh, intent on his impaled insects—capture the characteristic responses of a\ngeneration to the new and crushing experience of industrialism. ❹The other early chapters eloquently\nportray the development of the instinctive cooperation with each other that was already becoming an important\ntradition among workers.\n\n\f17.
