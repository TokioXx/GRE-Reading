{"title":"从神话中获取的史料是不准确的","passage":"1\n❶In large part as a consequence of the feminist movement, historians have focused a great deal of attention in\nrecent years on determining more accurately the status of women in various periods. ❷Although much has been\naccomplished for the modern period, premodern cultures have proved more difficult: sources are restricted in\nnumber, fragmentary, difficult to interpret, and often contradictory. ❸Thus it is not particularly surprising that\nsome earlier scholarship concerning such cultures has so far gone unchallenged. ❹An example is Johann\nBachofen‘s 1861 treatise on Amazons, women-ruled societies of questionable existence contemporary with\nancient Greece.\n\n❶Starting from the premise that mythology and legend preserve at least a nucleus of historical fact, Bachofen\nargued that women were dominant in many ancient societies. ❷His work was based on a comprehensive survey\nof references in the ancient sources to Amazonian and other societies with matrilineal customs—societies in\nwhich descent and property rights are traced through the female line. ❸Some support for his theory can be\nfound in evidence such as that drawn from Herodotus, the Greek ―historian‖ of the fifth century B. C., who\nspeaks of an Amazonian society, the Sauromatae, where the women hunted and fought in wars. ❹A woman in\nthis society was not allowed to marry until she had killed a person in battle.\n\n❶Nonetheless, this assumption that the first recorders of ancient myths have preserved facts is problematic.\n❷If one begins by examining why ancients refer to Amazons, it becomes clear that ancient Greek descriptions\nof such societies were meant not so much to represent observed historical fact—real Amazonian societies—but\nrather to offer ―moral lessons‖ on the supposed outcome of women‘s rule in their own society. ❸The Amazons\nwere often characterized, for example, as the equivalents of giants and centaurs, enemies to be slain by Greek\nheroes. ❹Their customs were presented not as those of a respectable society, but as the very antitheses of\nordinary Greek practices.\n❶Thus, I would argue, the purpose of accounts of the Amazons for their male Greek recorders was didactic, to\nteach both male and female Greeks that all-female groups, formed by withdrawal from traditional society, are\ndestructive and dangerous. ❷Myths about the Amazons were used as arguments for the male-dominated status\nquo, in which groups composed exclusively of either sex were not permitted to segregate themselves\npermanently from society. ❸Bachofen was thus misled in his reliance on myths for information about the status\nof women. ❹The sources that will probably tell contemporary historians most about women in the ancient\nworld are such social documents as gravestones, wills, and marriage contracts. ❺Studies of such documents\nhave already begun to show how mistaken we are when we try to derive our picture of the ancient world\nexclusively from literary sources, especially myths.\n\n\f21.
