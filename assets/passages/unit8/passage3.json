{"title":"CO2浓度对气候变化的影响","passage":"9\n❶Climatic conditions are delicately adjusted to the composition of the Earth‘s atmosphere. ❷If there were a\nchange in the atmosphere—for example, in the relative proportions of atmospheric gases—the climate would\nprobably change also. ❸A slight increase in water vapor, for instance, would increase the heat-retaining\ncapacity of the atmosphere and would lead to a rise in global temperatures. ❹In contrast, a large increase in\nwater vapor would increase the thickness and extent of the cloud layer, reducing the amount of solar energy\nreaching the Earth‘s surface.\n\n❶The level of carbon dioxide, CO2, in the atmosphere has an important effect on climatic change. ❷Most of\nthe Earth‘s incoming energy is short-wavelength radiation, which tends to pass through atmospheric CO2 easily.\n❸The Earth, however, reradiates much of the received energy as long-wavelength radiation, which CO2 absorbs\nand then remits toward the Earth. ❹This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, can result in an increase\nin the surface temperature of a planet. ❺An extreme example of the effect is shown by Venus, a planet covered\nby heavy clouds composed mostly of CO2, whose surface temperatures have been measured at 430℃. ❻If the\nCO2 content of the atmosphere is reduced, the temperature falls. ❼According to one respectable theory, if the\natmospheric CO2 concentration were halved, the Earth would become completely covered with ice. ❽Another\nequally respectable theory, however, states that a halving of the CO2 concentration would lead only to a\nreduction in global temperatures of 3℃.\n\n❶If, because of an increase in forest fires or volcanic activity, the CO2 content of the atmosphere increased, a\nwarmer climate would be produced. ❷Plant growth, which relies on both the warmth and the availability of\nCO2 would probably increase. ❸As a consequence, plants would use more and more CO2. ❹Eventually CO2\nlevels would diminish and the climate, in turn, would become cooler. ❺With reduced temperatures many plants\nwould die; CO2 would thereby be returned to the atmosphere and gradually the temperature would rise again.\n❻Thus, if this process occurred, there might be a long-term oscillation in the amount of CO2 present in the\natmosphere, with regular temperature increases and decreases of a set magnitude.\n\n❶Some climatologists argue that the burning of fossil fuels has raised the level of CO2 in the atmosphere and\nhas caused a global temperature increase of at least 1℃. ❷But a supposed global temperature rise of 1℃ may\nin reality be only several regional temperature increases, restricted to areas where there are many meteorological\nstations and caused simply by shifts in the pattern of atmospheric circulation. ❸Other areas, for example the\nSouthern Hemisphere oceanic zone, may be experiencing an equivalent temperature decrease that is\nunrecognized because of the shortage of meteorological recording stations.\n\n\f21.
