{"id":"ilvyr0010005","title":"史料忽略了肉类加工业的真实工作情况","content":["\n❶A recent history of the Chicago meat-packing industry and its workers examines how the industry grew from\nits appearance in the 1830‘s through the early 1890‘s. ❷Meat-packers, the author argues, had good wages,\nworking conditions, and prospects for advancement within the packinghouses, and did not cooperate with labor\nagitators since labor relations were so harmonious. ❸Because the history maintains that conditions were above\nstandard for the era, the frequency of labor disputes, especially in the mid-1880‘s, is not accounted for. ❹The\nwork ignores the fact that the 1880‘s were crucial years in American labor history, and that the packinghouse\nworkers‘ efforts were part of the national movement for labor reform.","❶In fact, other historical sources for the late nineteenth century record deteriorating housing and high disease\nand infant mortality rates in the industrial community, due to low wages and unhealthy working conditions.\n❷Additional data from the University of Chicago suggest that the packinghouses were dangerous places to\nwork. ❸The government investigation commissioned by President Theodore Roosevelt which eventually led to\nthe adoption of the 1906 Meat Inspection Act found the packinghouses unsanitary, while social workers\nobserved that most of the workers were poorly paid and overworked.","❶The history may be too optimistic because most of its data date from the 1880‘s at the latest, and the\ninformation provided from that decade is insufficiently analyzed. ❷Conditions actually declined in the 1880‘s,\nand continued to decline after the 1880‘s, due to a reorganization of the packing process and a massive influx of\nunskilled workers. ❸The deterioration in worker status, partly a result of the new availability of unskilled and\nhence cheap labor, is not discussed. ❹Though a detailed account of work in the packing-houses is attempted,\nthe author fails to distinguish between the wages and conditions for skilled workers and for those unskilled\nlaborers who comprised the majority of the industry‘s workers from the 1880‘s on. ❺While conditions for the\nformer were arguably tolerable due to the strategic importance of skilled workers in the complicated slaughtering,\ncutting, and packing process (though worker complaints about the rate and conditions of work were frequent),\npay and conditions for the latter were wretched.","❶The author‘s misinterpretation of the origins of the feelings the meat-packers had for their industrial\nneighborhood may account for the history‘s faulty generalizations. ❷The pride and contentment the author\nremarks upon were, arguably, less the products of the industrial world of the packers—the giant yards and the\nintricate plants—than of the unity and vibrance of the ethnic cultures that formed a viable community on\nChicago‘s South Side. ❸Indeed, the strength of this community succeeded in generating a social movement\nthat effectively confronted the problems of the industry that provided its livelihood.","\f21.
