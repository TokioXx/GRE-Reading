{"id":"ilvyr002003","title":"英国沙龙挑战了传统的女性社会角色","content":["\n❶In eighteenth-century France and England, reformers rallied around egalitarian ideals, but few reformers\nadvocated higher education for women. ❷Although the public decried women‘s lack of education, it did not\nencourage learning for its own sake for women. ❸In spite of the general prejudice against learned women, there\nwas one place where women could exhibit their erudition: the literary salon. ❹Many writers have defined the\nwoman‘s role in the salon as that of an intelligent hostess, but the salon had more than a social function for\nwomen. ❺It was an informal university, too, where women exchanged ideas with educated persons, read their\nown works and heard those of others, and received and gave criticism.","❶In the 1750‘s, when salons were firmly established in France, some English women, who called themselves\n―Bluestocking,‖ followed the example of the salonnieres (French salon hostesses) and formed their own salons.\n❷Most Bluestockings did not wish to mirror the salonnieres; they simply desired to adapt a proven formula to\ntheir own purpose—the elevation of women‘s status through moral and intellectual training. ❸Differences in\nsocial orientation and background can account perhaps for differences in the nature of French and English salons.\n❹The French salon incorporated aristocratic attitudes that exalted courtly pleasure and emphasized artistic\naccomplishments. ❺The English Bluestockings, originating from a more modest background, emphasized\nlearning and work over pleasure. ❻Accustomed to the regimented life of court circles, salonnieres tended\ntoward formality in their salons. ❼The English women, though somewhat puritanical, were more casual in their\napproach.","❶At first, the Bluestockings did imitate the salonnieres by including men in their circles. ❷However, as they\ngained cohesion, the Bluestockings came to regard themselves as a women‘s group and to possess a sense of\nfemale solidarity lacking in the salonnieres, who remained isolated from one another by the primacy each held in\nher own salon. ❸In an atmosphere of mutual support, the Bluestockings went beyond the salon experience.\n❹They traveled, studied, worked, wrote for publication, and by their activities challenged the stereotype of the\npassive woman. ❺Although the salonnieres were aware of sexual inequality, the narrow boundaries of their\nworld kept their intellectual pursuits within conventional limits. ❻Many salonnieres, in fact, camouflaged their\nnontraditional activities behind the role of hostess and deferred to men in public.","❶Though the Bluestockings were trailblazers when compared with the salonnieres, they were not feminists.\n❷They were too traditional, too hemmed in by their generation to demand social and political rights.\n❸Nonetheless, in their desire for education, their willingness to go beyond the confines of the salon in pursuing\ntheir interests, and their championing of unity among women, the Bluestockings began the process of\nquestioning women‘s role in society.","\f17.
