{"id":"ilvyr0015006","title":"解释艺术家创造的视觉效果","content":["\n❶Recent findings suggest that visual signals are fed into at least three separate processing systems in the brain,\neach with its own distinct function. ❷One system appears to process information about shape perception; a\nsecond, information about color; a third, information about movement, location, and spatial organization. ❸An\nunderstanding of the functions and capabilities of these three systems can shed light on how artists manipulate\nmaterials to create surprising visual effects.","❶It is possible to summarize the functions of the three subsystems of the visual system as follows. ❷The parvo\nsystem carries highly detailed information about stationary objects and about borders that are formed by\ncontrasting colors. ❸It does not, however, carry information about specific colors. ❹Because much of the\ninformation about the shape of objects can be represented by their borders, we suspect that this system is\nimportant in shape perception. ❺The blob system processes information about colors, but not about movement,\nshape discrimination, or depth. ❻The magno system carries information about movement and depth. ❼It is\ngood at detecting motion but poor at scrutinizing stationary images. ❽In addition it appears to be colorblind; it\nis unable to perceive borders that are visible only on the basis of color contrast.","❶Cells in the parvo system can distinguish between two colors at any relative brightness of the two. ❷Cells in\nthe color-blind magno system, on the other hand, are analogous to a black-and-white photograph in the way\nthey function: they signal information about the brightness of surfaces but not about their colors. ❸For any\npair of colors there is a particular brightness ratio at which two colors, for example red and green, will\nappear as the same shade of gray in a black-and-white photograph, hence any border between them will\nvanish. ❹Similarly at some relative red-to-green brightness level, the red and green will appear identical to the\nmagno system. ❺The red and green are then called equiluminant. ❻A border between two equiluminant colors\nhas color contrast but no luminance contrast.","❶Many artists have seemed to be empirically aware of these underlying principles and have used them to\nmaximize particular effects. ❷Some of the peculiar effects of Op Art, for example, probably arise from color\ncombinations that are strong activators of the parvo system but are weak stimuli for the magno system. ❸An\nobject that is equiluminant with its background looks vibrant and unstable. ❹The reason is that the parvo\nsystem can signal the object‘s shape but the magno system cannot see its borders and therefore cannot signal\neither the movement or the position of the object. ❺Hence it seems to jump around, drift, or vibrate on the\ncanvas.","\f21.
