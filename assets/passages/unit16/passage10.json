{"title":"人与动物的行为不能进行类比","passage":"46\n❶Chimps and children, gulls and Greeks—the ethologists go their merry way, comparing bits of human\ncultural behavior with bits of genetically programmed animal behavior. ❷True, humans are animals; they share\ncertain anatomical features with other animals, and some items of human behavior may seem analogous to the\nbehavior of other animals. ❸But such analogies can seriously mislead if we fail to look at the context of a\nparticular item of behavior. ❹Thus one ethologist compares the presentation of a twig by a cormorant with\ngift-giving in humans. ❺Yet the cormorant‘s twig-presentation simply inhibits attack and is comparable to other\nappeasement rituals found in many species. ❻Human gift-giving differs in form and purpose not only from\nculture to culture, but within the same culture in various social contexts. ❼Everything significant about it\nderives from its social context. ❽Thus, ethologists can accomplish little—beyond reminding us that we are\nanimals—until they study humans as cultural beings.\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author is primarily concerned with\n","options":["demonstrating the usefulness of ethology in discovering the behavioral limits within which humans\noperate\n","objecting to the degradation of humanity implicit in the ethologists equation of humans and animals\n","pointing out the dangers inherent in comparing highly dissimilar species, such as humans and\ncormorants, rather than similar ones, such as humans and apes\n","refuting the idea that the appeasement rituals in human cultural behavior can be profitably subjected to\nethological analysis\n","arguing that the ethologists‘ assumption that human behavior can be straightforwardly compared with\nanimal behavior is invalid\n"]},{"subject":" The author believes that gift-giving in humans\n","options":["is instinctive behavior\n","is analogous to appeasement rituals in other animals\n","is not an appropriate subject of study for ethologists\n","must be considered within its social context to be properly understood\n","may be a cultural remnant of behavior originally designed to inhibit attack\n"]},{"subject":" The author‘s attitude toward contemporary ethologists can best be described as\n","options":["puzzled\n","conciliatory\n","defensive\n","amused\n","disparaging\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following statements from a report on a cross-cultural study of gift-giving would, if true, most\nstrongly support the author‘s assertions concerning human gift-giving?\n","options":["In every culture studied, it was found that some forms of gift-giving are acts of aggression that place the\nreceiver under obligation to the giver.\n","Most governmental taxation systems differentiate between gifts of property given to children during a\nparent‘s lifetime, and a child‘s inheritance of the same property from a parent dying without a will.\n\n\f(C) Some gift-giving customs have analogous forms in nearly every culture, as in the almost universal\ncustom of welcoming strangers with gifts of food.\n","In North America, generally speaking, money is an acceptable holiday gift to one‘s letter carrier or\ngarbage collector, but is often considered an insult if given to one‘s employer, friends, or relatives.\n","Some gifts, being conciliatory in nature, indicate by their costliness the degree of hostility they must\nappease in the recipient.\n\n\f137 D\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n138 E\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n139 A\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n140 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n141 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n142 A\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n143 A\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n144 D\n\n","\n\n","\n\n145 A\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n146 E\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n\f"]}]}
