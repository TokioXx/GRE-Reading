{"title":"Griffith推动了电影的发展","passage":"39\n❶Practically speaking, the artistic maturing of the cinema was the single-handed achievement of David W.\nGriffith (1875-1948). ❷Before Griffith, photography in dramatic films consisted of little more than placing the\nactors before a stationary camera and showing them in full length as they would have appeared on stage.\n❸From the beginning of his career as a director, however, Griffith, because of his love of Victorian painting,\nemployed composition. ❹He conceived of the camera image as having a foreground and a rear ground, as well\nas the middle distance preferred by most directors. ❺By 1910 he was using close-ups to reveal significant\ndetails of the scene or of the acting and extreme long shots to achieve a sense of spectacle and distance. ❻His\nappreciation of the camera‘s possibilities produced novel dramatic effects. ❼By splitting an event into\nfragments and recording each from the most suitable camera position, he could significantly vary the emphasis\nfrom camera shot to camera shot.\n\n❶Griffith also achieved dramatic effects by means of creative editing. ❷By juxtaposing images and varying\nthe speed and rhythm of their presentation, he could control the dramatic intensity of the events as the story\nprogressed. ❸Despite the reluctance of his producers, who feared that the public would not be able to follow a\nplot that was made up of such juxtaposed images, Griffith persisted, and experimented as well with other\nelements of cinematic syntax that have become standard ever since. ❹These included the flashback, permitting\nbroad psychological and emotional exploration as well as narrative that was not chronological, and the crosscut\nbetween two parallel actions to heighten suspense and excitement. ❺In thus exploiting fully the possibilities of\nediting, Griffith transposed devices of the Victorian novel to film and gave film mastery of time as well as space.\n\n❶Besides developing the cinema‘s language, Griffith immensely broadened its range and treatment of subjects.\n❷His early output was remarkably eclectic: it included not only the standard comedies, melodramas, westerns,\nand thrillers, but also such novelties as adaptations from Browning and Tennyson, and treatments of social issues.\n❸As his successes mounted, his ambitions grew, and with them the whole of American cinema. ❹When he\nremade Enoch Arden in 1911, he insisted that a subject of such importance could not be treated in the then\nconventional length of one reel. ❺Griffith‘s introduction of the American-made multireel picture began an\nimmense revolution. ❻Two years later, Judith of Bethulia, an elaborate historicophilosophical spectacle,\nreached the unprecedented length of four reels, or one hour‘s running time. ❼From our contemporary viewpoint,\nthe pretensions of this film may seem a trifle ludicrous, but at the time it provoked endless debate and discussion\nand gave a new intellectual respectability to the cinema.\n\n\f21.
