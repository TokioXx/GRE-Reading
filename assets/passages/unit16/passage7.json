{"title":"HDR蕴含巨大经济价值","passage":"43\n❶The energy contained in rock within the earth‘s crust represents a nearly unlimited energy source, but\nuntil recently commercial retrieval has been limited to underground hot water and/or steam recovery systems.\n❷These systems have been developed in areas of recent volcanic activity, where high rates of heat flow cause\nvisible eruption of water in the form of geysers and hot springs. ❸In other areas, however, hot rock also exists\nnear the surface but there is insufficient water present to produce eruptive phenomena. ❹Thus a potential hot\ndry rock (HDR) reservoir exists whenever the amount of spontaneously produced geothermal fluid has been\njudged inadequate for existing commercial systems.\n\n❶As a result of recent energy crisis, new concepts for creating HDR recovery systems—which involve\ndrilling holes and connecting them to artificial reservoirs placed deep within the crust—are being developed.\n❷In all attempts to retrieve energy from HDR‘s, artificial stimulation will be required to create either sufficient\npermeability or bounded flow paths to facilitate the removal of heat by circulation of a fluid over the surface of\nthe rock.\n\n❶The HDR resource base is generally defined to included crustal rock that is hotter than 150℃, is at\ndepths less than ten kilometers, and can be drilled with presently available equipment. ❷Although wells deeper\nthan ten kilometers are technically feasible, prevailing economic factors will obviously determine the\ncommercial feasibility of wells at such depths. ❸Rock temperatures as low as 100℃ may be useful for space\nheating; however, for producing electricity, temperatures greater than 200℃ are desirable.\n\n❶The geothermal gradient, which specifically determines the depth of drilling required to reach a desired\ntemperature, is a major factor in the recoverability of geothermal resources. ❷Temperature gradient maps\ngenerated from oil and gas well temperature-depth records kept by the American Association of Petroleum\nGeologists suggest that tappable high-temperature gradients are distributed all across the United States. ❸\n(There are many areas, however, for which no temperature gradient records exist.)\n\n❶Indications are that the HDR resource base is very large. ❷If an average geothermal temperature\ngradient of 22℃per kilometer of depth is used, a staggering 13,000,000 quadrillion B.T.U.‘s of total energy are\ncalculated to be contained in crustal rock to a ten-kilometer depth in the United States. ❸If we conservatively\nestimate that only about 0.2 percent is recoverable, we find a total of all the coal remaining in the United States.\n❹The remaining problem is to balance the economics of deeper, hotter, more costly wells and shallower, cooler,\nless expensive wells against the value of the final product, electricity and/or heat.\n\n\f21.
