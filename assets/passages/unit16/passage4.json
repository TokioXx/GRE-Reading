{"title":"需要研究写实","passage":"40\n(This passage is from a book published in 1960.)\n❶When we consider great painters of the past, the study of art and the study of illusion cannot always be\nseparated. ❷By illusion I mean those contrivances of color, line, shape, and so forth that lead us to see marks on\na flat surface as depicting three-dimensional objects in space. ❸I must emphasize that I am not making a plea,\ndisguised or otherwise, for the exercise of illusionist tricks in painting today, although I am, in fact, rather\ncritical of certain theories of non-representational art. ❹But to argue over these theories would be to miss\nthe point. ❺That the discoveries and effects of representation that were the pride of earlier artists have become\ntrivial today I would not deny for a moment. ❻Yet I believe that we are in real danger of losing contact with\npast masters if we accept the fashionable doctrine that such matters never had anything to do with art. ❼The\nvery reason why the representation of nature can now be considered something commonplace should be of the\ngreatest interest to art historians. ❽Never before has there been an age when the visual image was so cheap in\nevery sense of the word. ❾We are surrounded and assailed by posters and advertisements, comics and magazine\nillustrations. ❿We see aspects of reality represented on television, postage stamps, and food packages. 11\n○\nPainting is taught in school and practiced as a pastime, and many modest amateurs have mastered tricks that\nwould have looked like sheer magic to the fourteenth-century painter Giotto. 12Even\nthe crude colored\n○\nrenderings on a cereal box might have made Giotto‘s contemporaries gasp. 13Perhaps\nthere are people who\n○\nconclude from this that the cereal box is superior to a Giotto; I do not. 14But\nI think that the victory and\n○\nvulgarization of representational skills create a problem for both art historians and critics.\n\n❶In this connection it is instructive to remember the Greek saying that to marvel is the beginning of\nknowledge and if we cease to marvel we may be in danger of ceasing to know. ❷I believe we must restore our\nsense of wonder at the capacity to conjure up by forms, lines, shades, or colors those mysterious phantoms of\nvisual reality we call ―pictures‖ . ❸Even comics and advertisements, rightly viewed, provide food for thought.\n❹Just as the study of poetry remains incomplete without an awareness of the language of prose, so, I believe,\nthe study of art will be increasingly supplemented by inquiry into the ―linguistics‖ of the visual image. ❺The\nway the language of art refers to the visible world is both so obvious and so mysterious that it is still largely\nunknown except to artists, who use it as we use all language—without needing to know its grammar and\nsemantics.\n\n\f17. The author of the passage explicitly disagrees with which of the following statements‘\n(A) In modern society even nonartists can master techniques that great artists of the fourteenth century did\nnot employ.\n(B) The ability to represent a three-dimensional object on a flat surface has nothing to do with art.\n(C) In modern society the victory of representational skills has created a problem for art critics.\n(D) The way that artists are able to represent the visible world is an area that needs a great deal more study\nbefore it can be fully understood.\n(E) Modern painters do not frequently make use of illusionist tricks in their work.\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author suggests which of the following about art historians?\n","options":["They do not believe that illusionist tricks have become trivial.\n","They generally spend little time studying contemporary artists.\n","They have not given enough consideration to how the representation of nature has become\ncommonplace.\n","They generally tend to argue about theories rather than address substantive issues.\n","They are less likely than art critics to study comics or advertisements.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following best states the author‘s attitude toward comics, as expressed in the passage?\n","options":["They constitute an innovative art form.\n","They can be a worthwhile subject for study.\n","They are critically important to an understanding of modem art.\n","Their visual structure is more complex than that of medieval art.\n","They can be understood best if they are examined in conjunction with advertisements.\n"]},{"subject":" The author‘s statement regarding how artists use the language of art (lines 48-52) implies that\n","options":["artists are better equipped than are art historians to provide detailed evaluations of other artists‘ work\n","many artists have an unusually quick, intuitive understanding of language\n","artists can produce works of art even if they cannot analyze their methods of doing so\n","artists of the past, such as Giotto, were better educated about artistic issues than were artists of the\nauthor‘s time\n","most artists probably consider the processes involved in their work to be closely akin to those involved\nin writing poetry\n"]},{"subject":" The passage asserts which of the following about commercial art?\n","options":["There are many examples of commercial art whose artistic merit is equal to that of great works of art of\nthe past.\n","Commercial art is heavily influenced by whatever doctrines are fashionable in the serious art world of\nthe time.\n","The line between commercial art and great art lies primarily in how an image is used, not in the\nmotivation for its creation.\n","The level of technical skill required to produce representational imagery in commercial art and in other\nkinds of art cannot be compared.\n\n\f(E) The pervasiveness of contemporary commercial art has led art historians to undervalue representational\nskills.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the adherents of ―certain theories of\nnonrepresentational art‖ (lines 9-10)?\n","options":["They consider the use of illusion to be inappropriate in contemporary art.\n","They do not agree that marks on a flat surface can ever satisfactorily convey the illusion of\nthree-dimensional space.\n","They do not discuss important works of art created in the past.\n","They do not think that the representation of nature was ever the primary goal of past painters.\n","They concern themselves more with types of art such as advertisements and magazine illustrations than\nwith traditional art.\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that someone who wanted to analyze the ―grammar and semantics‖ (line\n52) of the language of art would most appropriately comment on which of the following?\n","options":["The relationship between the drawings in a comic strip and the accompanying text\n","The amount of detail that can be included in a tiny illustration on a postage stamp\n","The sociological implications of the images chosen to advertise a particular product\n","The degree to which various colors used in different versions of the same poster would attract the\nattention of passersby\n","The particular juxtaposition of shapes in an illustration that makes one shape look as though it were\nbehind another\n\n\f"]}]}
