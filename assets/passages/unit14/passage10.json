{"title":"地震反射法是探寻石油储存的最重要的工具","passage":"26\n❶Because of its accuracy in outlining the Earth‘s subsurface, the seismic-reflection method remains the most\nimportant tool in the search for petroleum reserves. ❷In field practice, a subsurface is mapped by arranging a\nseries of wave-train sources, such as small dynamite explosions, in a grid pattern. ❸As each source is activated,\nit generates a wave train that moves downward at a speed determined uniquely by the rock‘s elastic\ncharacteristics. ❹As rock interfaces are crossed, the elastic characteristics encountered generally change\nabruptly, which causes part of the energy to be reflected back to the surface, where it is recorded by seismic\ninstruments. ❺The seismic records must be processed to correct for positional differences between the source\nand the receiver, for unrelated wave trains, and for multiple reflections from the rock interfaces. ❻Then the data\nacquired at each of the specific source locations are combined to generate a physical profile of the subsurface,\nwhich can eventually be used to select targets for drilling.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" The passage is primarily concerned with\n","options":["describing an important technique\n","discussing a new method\n","investigating a controversial procedure\n","announcing a significant discovery\n","promoting a novel application\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, in the seismic-reflection method all of the following have a significant effect on\nthe signal detected by the seismic instruments EXCEPT the\n","options":["presence of unrelated wave trains\n","placement of the seismic instruments\n","number of sources in the grid pattern\n","nature of the reflectivity of the rock interfaces\n","properties of rocks through which the wave train has traveled\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the seismic-reflection method would be likely to yield an inaccurate\nphysical profile of the subsurface in which of the following circumstances?\n","options":["If the speed at which the wave train moved downward changed\n","If the receiver were not positioned directly at the wave-train source\n","If the rock on one side of a rock interface had similar elastic characteristics to those of the rock on the\nother side\n","If the seismic records obtained for the different sources in a grid were highly similar to each other\n","If there were no petroleum deposits beneath the area defined by the grid of wave-train sources\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?\n","options":["A method is criticized, and an alternative is suggested.\n","An illustration is examined, and some errors are exposed.\n","An assertion is made, and a procedure is outlined.\n","A series of examples is presented, and a conclusion is drawn.\n\n\f(E) A hypothesis is advanced, and supporting evidence is supplied.\n\n\f117 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n118 EB D\n\n","\n\n","\n\n119 D\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n120 E\n\n","\n\n","\n\n121 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n122 C\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n123 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n124 C\n\n","\n\n","\n\n125 B\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n126 A\n\n","\n\n","\n\n","\n\n\f"]}]}
