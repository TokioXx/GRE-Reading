{"id":"ilvyr0015004","title":"玻璃金属的结构、形成原理和发展前景","content":["\n❶The intensive work of materials scientists and solid-state physicists has given rise to a class of solids known\nas amorphous metallic alloys, or glassy metals. ❷There is a growing interest among theoretical and applied\nresearchers alike in the structural properties of these materials.","❶When a molten metal or metallic alloy is cooled to a solid, a crystalline structure is formed that depends on\nthe particular alloy composition. ❷In contrast, molten nonmetallic glass-forming materials, when cooled, do not\nassume a crystalline structure, but instead retain a structure somewhat like that of the liquid—an amorphous\nstructure. ❸At room temperature, the natural long-term tendency for both types of materials is to assume the\ncrystalline structure. ❹The difference between the two is in the kinetics or rate of formation of the crystalline\nstructure, which is controlled by factors such as the nature of the chemical bonding and the ease with which\natoms move relative to each other. ❺Thus, in metals, the kinetics favors rapid formation of a crystalline\nstructure, whereas in nonmetallic glasses the rate of formation is so slow that almost any cooling rate is sufficient\nto result in an amorphous structure. ❻For glassy metals to be formed, the molten metal must be cooled\nextremely rapidly so that crystallization is suppressed.","❶The structure of glassy metals is thought to be similar to that of liquid metals. ❷One of the first attempts to\nmodel the structure of a liquid was that by the late J. D. Bernal of the University of London, who packed hard\nspheres into a rubber vessel in such a way as to obtain the maximum possible density. ❸The resulting dense,\nrandom-packed structure was the basis for many attempts to model the structure of glassy metals.\n❹Calculations of the density of alloys based on Bernal-type models of the alloys metal component agreed fairly\nwell with the experimentally determined values from measurements on alloys consisting of a noble metal\ntogether with a metalloid, such as alloys of palladium and silicon, or alloys consisting of iron, phosphorus, and\ncarbon, although small discrepancies remained. ❺One difference between real alloys and the hard spheres used\nin Bernal models is that the components of an alloy have different sizes, so that models based on two sizes of\nspheres are more appropriate for a binary alloy, for example. ❻The smaller metalloid atoms of the alloy might\nfit into holes in the dense, random-packed structure of the larger metal atoms.","❶One of the most promising properties of glassy metals is their high strength combined with high malleability.\n❷In usual crystalline materials, one finds an inverse relation between the two properties, whereas for many\npractical applications simultaneous presence of both properties is desirable. ❸One residual obstacle to practical\napplications that is likely to be overcome is the fact that glassy metals will crystallize at relatively low\ntemperatures when heated slightly.","\f21.
