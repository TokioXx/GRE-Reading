Piaget in his hypothesis that\nbecause of their immaturity, children under age seven do not take into account the intentions of a person\ncommitting accidental or deliberate harm, but rather simply assign punishment for transgressions on the basis of\nthe magnitude of the negative consequences caused. ❸According to Piaget, children under age seven occupy\nthe first stage of moral development, which is characterized by moral absolutism (rules made by authorities must\nbe obeyed) and imminent justice (if rules are broken, punishment will be meted out). ❹Until young children\nmature, their moral judgments are based entirely on the effect rather than the cause of a transgression.\n❺However, in recent research, Keasey found that six-year-old children not only distinguish between accidental\nand intentional harm, but also judge intentional harm as naughtier, regardless of the amount of damage produced.\n❻Both of these findings seem to indicate that children, at an earlier age than Piaget claimed, advance into the\nsecond stage of moral development, moral autonomy, in which they accept social rules but view them as more\narbitrary than do children in the first stage.\n❶Keasey‘s research raises two key questions for developmental psychologists about children under age seven:\ndo they recognize justifications for harmful actions, and do they make distinctions between harmful acts that are\npreventable and those acts that have unforeseen harmful consequences? ❷Studies indicate that justifications\nexcusing harmful actions might include public duty, self-defense, and provocation. ❸For example, Nesdale\nand Rule concluded that children were capable of considering whether or not an aggressor‘s action was justified\nby public duty: five year olds reacted very differently to ―Bonnie wrecks Ann‘s pretend house‖ depending on\nwhether Bonnie did it ―so somebody won‘t fall over it‖ or because Bonnie wanted ―to make Ann feel bad.‖\n❹Thus, a child of five begins to understand that certain harmful actions, though intentional, can be justified; the\nconstraints of moral absolutism no longer solely guide their judgments.\n❶Psychologists have determined that during kindergarten children learn to make subtle distinctions involving\nharm. ❷Darley observed that among acts involving unintentional harm, six-year-old children just entering\nkindergarten could not differentiate between foreseeable, and thus preventable, harm and unforeseeable harm for\nwhich the perpetrator cannot be blamed. ❸Seven months later, however, Darley found that these same children\ncould make both distinctions, thus demonstrating that they had become morally autonomous.","\f21.
