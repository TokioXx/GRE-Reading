{"id":"ilvyr0017007","title":"现代考古发现对古代文学研究有很大贡献","content":["\n❶Modern archaeological finds can still contribute much to the study of ancient literature. ❷For example, forty\nyears ago a survey of the early Greek dramatist Aeschylus‘ plays would have started with The Suppliant Women.\n❸Many factors internal to the play, but perhaps most especially the prominence of the chorus (which in this\nplay has the main role), led scholars to consider it one of Aeschylus‘ earlier works. ❹The consensus was that\nhere was a drama truly reflecting an early stage in the evolution of tragedy out of choral lyric. ❺The play was\ndated as early as the 490‘s B.C., in any event, well before Aeschylus‘ play The Persians of 472 B.C. ❻Then, in\n1952, a fragment of papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus was published stating the official circumstances and results\nof a dramatic contest. ❼The fragment announced that Aeschylus won first prize with his Danaid tetralogy, of\nwhich The Suppliant Women is the opening play, and defeated Sophocles in the process. ❽Sophocles did not\ncompete in any dramatic contest before 468 B.C., when he won his first victory. ❾Hence, except by special\npleading (e. g., that the tetralogy was composed early in Aeschylus‘ career but not produced until the 460‘s B.C.),\nthe Danaid tetralogy must be put after 468 B.C. ❿In addition, a few letters in the fragment suggest the name\nArchedemides, archon in 463 B.C., thus perhaps tying the plays to that precise date, almost exactly halfway\nbetween Aeschylus‘ Seven Against Thebes of 467 B.C. and his Oresteia.","❶The implication of the papyrus administered a severe shock to the vast majority of classical scholars, who had\nconfidently asserted that not only the role of the chorus but also language, metrics, and characterization all\npointed to an early date. ❷The discovery has resulted in no less than a total reevaluation of every chronological\ncriterion that has been applied to or derived from Aeschylus‘ plays. ❸The activity has been brisk, and a new\ncreed has now spread. ❹The prominence of the chorus in The Suppliant Women now is seen not as a sign of\nprimitivism but as analogous to the massive choral songs of the Oresteia. ❺Statistics have been formulated, or\nreformulated, to show that stylistically The Suppliant Women does actually occupy a position after The Persians\nand Seven Against Thebes, which now become the ―primitive‖ plays, and before the Oresteia. ❻While the new\ndoctrine seems almost certainly correct, the one papyrus fragment raises the specter that another may be\nunearthed, showing, for instance, that it was a posthumous production of the Danaid tetralogy which bested\nSophocles, and throwing the date once more into utter confusion. ❼This is unlikely to happen, but it warns us\nthat perhaps the most salutary feature of the papyrus scrap is its message of the extreme difficulty of classifying\nand categorizing rigidly the development of a creative artist.","\f21.
