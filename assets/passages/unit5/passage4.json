{"title":"King为了将两场运动的利益最大化没有一开始就公开反对越战","passage":"9\n❶The 1960‘s witnessed two profound social movements: the civil rights movement and the movement\nprotesting the war in Vietnam. ❷Although they overlapped in time, they were largely distinct. ❸For a brief\nmoment in 1967, however, it appeared that the two movements might unite under the leadership of Martin\nLuther King, Jr.\n❶King‘s role in the antiwar movement appears to require little explanation, since he was the foremost advocate\nof nonviolence of his time. ❷But King’s stance on the Vietnam War cannot be explained in terms of\npacifism alone. ❸After all, he was something of a latecomer to the antiwar movement, even though by 1965 he\nwas convinced that the role of the United States in the war was indefensible. ❹Why then the two years that\npassed before he translated his private misgivings into public dissent? ❺Perhaps he believed that he could\nnot criticize American foreign policy without endangering the support for civil rights that he had won from the\nfederal government.\n","questions":[{"subject":" According to the passage, the delay referred to in lines 12-15 is perhaps attributable to which of the\nfollowing?\n","options":["King‘s ambivalence concerning the role of the United States in the war in Vietnam\n","King‘s attempts to consolidate support for his leadership within the civil rights movement\n","King‘s desire to keep the leadership of the civil rights movement distinct from that of the antiwar\nmovement\n","King‘s desire to draw support for the civil rights movement from the leadership of the antiwar\nmovement\n","King‘s reluctance to jeopardize federal support for the civil rights movement\n"]},{"subject":" The author supports the claim that ―King‘s stance on the Vietnam War cannot be explained in terms of\npacifism alone‖ by implying which of the following?\n","options":["There is little evidence that King was ever a student of pacifist doctrine.\n","King, despite pacifist sympathies, was not convinced that the policy of the federal government in\nVietnam was wrong.\n","King‘s belief in nonviolence was formulated in terms of domestic policy rather than in terms of\ninternational issues.\n","Had King‘s actions been based on pacifism alone, he would have joined the antiwar movement earlier\nthan he actually did.\n","Opponents of United States foreign policy within the federal government convinced King of their need\nfor support.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the movement opposing the war in Vietnam?\n","options":["It preceded the civil rights movement.\n","It began in 1965.\n","It was supported by many who otherwise opposed public dissent.\n","It drew support from most civil rights leaders.\n","It was well underway by 1967.\n\n\f20.
