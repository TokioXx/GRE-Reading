{"title":"需要研究恒温动物发烧与铁元素有关这一假设","passage":"4\n(This passage is excerpted from an article that was published in 1982.)\n❶Warm-blooded animals have elaborate physiological controls to maintain constant body temperature (in\nhumans, 37℃). ❷Why then during sickness should temperature rise, apparently increasing stress on the\ninfected organism? ❸It has long been known that the level of serum iron in animals falls during infection.\n❹Garibaldi first suggested a relationship between fever and iron. ❺He found that microbial synthesis of\nsiderophores—substances that bind iron—in bacteria of the genus Salmonella declined at environmental\ntemperatures above 37℃ and stopped at 40.3℃. ❻Thus, fever would make it more difficult for an infecting\nbacterium to acquire iron and thus to multiply. ❼Cold-blooded animals were used to test this hypothesis\nbecause their body temperature can be controlled in the laboratory. ❽Kluger reported that of iguanas infected\nwith the potentially lethal bacterium A. hydrophilia, more survived at temperatures of 42℃ than at 37℃, even\nthough healthy animals prefer the lower temperature. ❾When animals at 42℃ were injected with an iron\nsolution, however, mortality rates increased significantly. ❿Research to determine whether similar phenomena\noccur in warm-blooded animals is sorely needed.\n","questions":[{"subject":" The passage is primarily concerned with attempts to determine\n","options":["the role of siderophores in the synthesis of serum iron\n","new treatments for infections that are caused by A. hydrophilia\n","the function of fever in warm-blooded animals\n","the mechanisms that ensure constant body temperature\n","iron utilization in cold-blooded animals\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, Garibaldi determined which of the following?\n","options":["That serum iron is produced through microbial synthesis.\n","That microbial synthesis of siderophores in warm-blooded animals is more efficient at higher\ntemperatures.\n","That only iron bound to other substances can be used by bacteria.\n","That there is a relationship between the synthesis of siderophores in bacteria of the genus Salmonella\nand environmental temperature.\n","That bacteria of the genus Salmonella require iron as a nutrient.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following can be inferred about warm-blooded animals solely on the basis of information in\nthe passage?\n","options":["The body temperatures of warm-blooded animals cannot be easily controlled in the laboratory.\n","Warm-blooded animals require more iron in periods of stress than they do at other times.\n","Warm-blooded animals are more comfortable at an environmental temperature of 37℃ than they are at\na temperature of 42℃.\n","In warm-blooded animals, bacteria are responsible for the production of siderophores, which, in turn,\nmake iron available to the animal.\n","In warm-blooded animals, infections that lead to fever are usually traceable to bacteria.\n"]},{"subject":" If it were to be determined that ―similar phenomena occur in warm-blooded animals‖, which of the\nfollowing, assuming each is possible, is likely to be the most effective treatment for warm-blooded animals\n\n\fwith bacterial infections?\n","options":["Administering a medication that lowers the animals‘ body temperature\n","Injecting the animals with an iron solution\n","Administering a medication that makes serum iron unavailable to bacteria\n","Providing the animals with reduced-iron diets\n","Keeping the animals in an environment with temperatures higher than 37℃\n\n\f"]}]}
