{"title":"讨论视觉识别并支持其是一个多步串联的过程","passage":"6\n❶Visual recognition involves storing and retrieving memories. ❷Neural activity, triggered by the eye, forms an\nimage in the brain‘s memory system that constitutes an internal representation of the viewed object. ❸When an\nobject is encountered again, it is matched with its internal representation and thereby recognized. ❹Controversy\nsurrounds the question of whether recognition is a parallel, one-step process or a serial, step-by-step one.\n❺Psychologists of the Gestalt school maintain that objects are recognized as wholes in a parallel procedure: the\ninternal representation is matched with the retinal image in a single operation. ❻Other psychologists have\nproposed that internal representation features are matched serially with an object‘s features. ❼Although some\nexperiments show that, as an object becomes familiar, its internal representation becomes more holistic and the\nrecognition process correspondingly more parallel, the weight of evidence seems to support the serial hypothesis,\nat least for objects that are not notably simple and familiar.\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author is primarily concerned with\n","options":["explaining how the brain receives images\n","synthesizing hypotheses of visual recognition\n","examining the evidence supporting the serial recognition hypothesis\n","discussing visual recognition and some hypotheses proposed to explain it\n","reporting on recent experiments dealing with memory systems and their relationship to neural activity\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, Gestalt psychologists make which of the following suppositions about visual\nrecognition?\nI.\n\n","options":["retinal image is in exactly the same forms as its internal representation.\n\nII.\n\n","n object is recognized as a whole without any need for analysis into component parts.\n\nIII.
