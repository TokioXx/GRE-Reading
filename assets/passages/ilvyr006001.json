{"id":"ilvyr006001","title":"tunneling与史前寒冷时期生命的形成有关","content":["\n❶About a century ago, the Swedish physical scientist Arrhenius proposed a law of classical chemistry that\nrelates chemical reaction rate to temperature. ❷According to the Arrhenius equation, chemical reactions are\nincreasingly unlikely to occur as temperatures approach absolute zero, and at absolute zero (zero degrees Kelvin,\nor minus 273 degrees Celsius) reactions stop. ❸However, recent experimental evidence reveals that although\nthe Arrhenius equation is generally accurate in describing the kind of chemical reaction that occurs at relatively\nhigh temperatures, at temperatures closer to zero a quantum-mechanical effect known as tunneling comes into\nplay; this effect accounts for chemical reactions that are forbidden by the principles of classical chemistry.\n❹Specifically, entire molecules can ―tunnel‖ through the barriers of repulsive forces from other molecules and\nchemically react even though these molecules do not have sufficient energy, according to classical chemistry, to\novercome the repulsive barrier.","❶The rate of any chemical reaction, regardless of the temperature at which it takes place, usually depends on a\nvery important characteristic known as its activation energy. ❷Any molecule can be imagined to reside at the\nbottom of a so-called potential well of energy. ❸A chemical reaction corresponds to the transition of a molecule\nfrom the bottom of one potential well to the bottom of another. ❹In classical chemistry, such a transition can be\naccomplished only by going over the potential barrier between the wells, the height of which remains constant\nand is called the activation energy of the reaction. ❺In tunneling, the reacting molecules tunnel from the bottom\nof one to the bottom of another well without having to rise over the barrier between the two wells. ❻Recently\nresearchers have developed the concept of tunneling temperature: the temperature below which tunneling\ntransitions greatly outnumber Arrhenius transitions, and classical mechanics gives way to its quantum\ncounterpart.","❶This tunneling phenomenon at very low temperatures suggested my hypothesis about a cold prehistory of life:\nthe formation of rather complex organic molecules in the deep cold of outer space, where temperatures usually\nreach only a few degrees Kelvin. ❷Cosmic rays (high-energy protons and other particles) might trigger the\nsynthesis of simple molecules, such as interstellar formaldehyde, in dark clouds of interstellar dust. ❸Afterward\ncomplex organic molecules would be formed, slowly but surely, by means of tunneling. ❹After I offered my\nhypothesis, Hoyle and Wickramasinghe argued that molecules of interstellar formaldehyde have indeed evolved\ninto stable polysaccharides such as cellulose and starch. ❺Their conclusions, although strongly disputed, have\ngenerated excitement among investigators such as myself who are proposing that the galactic clouds are the\nplaces where the prebiological evolution of compounds necessary to life occurred.","\f21.
