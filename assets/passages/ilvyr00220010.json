{"id":"ilvyr00220010","title":"给出Ragtime音乐的定义，并且描述其结构特征","content":["\n❶Ragtime is a musical form that synthesizes folk melodies and musical techniques into a brief\nquadrille-like structure, designed to be played—exactly as written—on the piano. ❷A strong analogy exists\nbetween European composers like Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edvard Grieg, and Anton Dvorak who combined\nfolk tunes and their own original materials in larger compositions and the pioneer ragtime composers in the\nUnited States. ❸Composers like Scott Joplin and James Scott were in a sense collectors or musicologists,\ncollecting dance and folk music in Black communities and consciously shaping it into brief suites or anthologies\ncalled piano rags.\n❶It has sometimes been charged that ragtime is mechanical. ❷For instance, Wilfred Mellers comments,\n―rags were transferred to the pianola roll and, even if not played by a machine, should be played like a machine,\nwith meticulous precision.‖ ❸However, there is no reason to assume that ragtime is inherently mechanical\nsimply because commercial manufacturers applied a mechanical recording method to ragtime, the only way to\nrecord pianos at that date. ❹Ragtime‘s style is not a mechanical precision, and it is not precision that limited to\nthe style of performance. ❺It arises from ragtime‘s following a well-defined form and obeying simple rules\nwithin that form.\n❶The classic formula for the piano rag disposes three to five themes in sixteen-bar strains, often organized\nwith repeats. ❷The rag opens with a bright, memorable strain or theme, followed by a similar theme, leading to\na trio of marked lyrical character, with the structure concluded by a lyrical strain that parallels the rhythmic\ndevelopments of the earlier themes. ❸The aim of the structure is to rise from one theme to another in a\nstair-step manner, ending on a note of triumph or exhilaration. ❹Typically, each strain is divided into two 8-bar\nsegments that are essentially alike, so the rhythmic-melodic unit of ragtime is only eight bars of 2/4 measure.\n❺Therefore, themes must be brief with clear, sharp melodic figures. ❻Not concerned with development of\nmusical themes, the ragtime composer instead sets a theme down intact, in finished form, and links it to various\nrelated themes. ❼Tension in ragtime compositions arises from a polarity between two basic ingredients: a\ncontinuous bass—called by jazz musicians a boom-chick bass—in the pianist‘s left hand, and its melodic,\nsyncopated counterpart in the right hand.\n❶Ragtime remains distinct from jazz both as an instrumental style and as a genre. ❷Ragtime style\nstresses a pattern of repeated rhythms, not the constant inventions and variations of jazz. ❸As a genre, ragtime\nrequires strict attention to structure, not inventiveness or virtuosity. ❹It exists as a tradition, a set of\nconventions, a body of written scores, separate from the individual players associated with it. ❺In this sense\nragtime is more akin to folk music of the nineteenth century than to jazz.","\f17.
