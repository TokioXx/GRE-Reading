{"title":"“枕状岩”是名称误用","passage":"6\n❶Volcanic rock that forms as fluid lava chills rapidly is called pillow lava (pillow lava: 枕状熔岩). ❷This\nrapid chilling occurs when lava erupts directly into water (or beneath ice) or when it flows across a shoreline and\ninto a body of water. ❸While the term ―pillow lava‖ suggests a definite shape, in fact geologists disagree.\n❹Some geologists argue that pillow lava is characterized by discrete, ellipsoidal masses. ❺Others describe\npillow lava as a tangled mass of cylindrical, interconnected flow lobes. ❻Much of this controversy probably\nresults from unwarranted extrapolations of the original configuration of pillow flows from two-dimensional cross\nsections of eroded pillows in land outcroppings (OUTCROP (outcrop: n.露出地面的岩层)). ❼Virtually any\ncross section (cross section: n.横截面) cut through a tangled mass of interconnected flow lobes would give the\nappearance of a pile of discrete ellipsoidal masses. ❽Adequate three-dimensional images of intact pillows are\nessential for defining the true geometry of pillowed flows and thus ascertaining their mode of origin. ❾Indeed,\nthe term ―pillow,‖ itself suggestive of discrete masses, is probably a misnomer.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" Which of the following is a fact presented in the passage?\n","options":["The shape of the connections between the separate, sacklike masses in pillow lava is unknown.\n","More accurate cross sections of pillow lava would reveal the mode of origin.\n","Water or ice is necessary for the formation of pillow lava.\n","No three-dimensional examples of intact pillows currently exist.\n","The origin of pillow lava is not yet known.\n"]},{"subject":" In the passage, the author is primarily interested in\n","options":["analyzing the source of a scientific controversy\n","criticizing some geologists‘ methodology\n","pointing out the flaws in a geological study\n","proposing a new theory to explain existing scientific evidence\n","describing a physical phenomenon\n"]},{"subject":" The author of the passage would most probably agree that the geologists mentioned in the highlighted\nportion (―Some geologists‖) have made which of the following errors in reasoning?\nI.\n\n","options":["eneralized unjustifiably from available evidence.\n\nII.\n\n","eliberately ignored existing counterevidence.\n\nIII.
