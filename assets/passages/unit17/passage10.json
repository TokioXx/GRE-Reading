{"title":"研究殖民者的冲突很重要","passage":"56\n❶Some recent historians have argued that life in the British colonies in America from approximately 1763 to\n1789 was marked by internal conflicts among colonists. ❷Inheritors of some of the viewpoints of early\ntwentieth-century Progressive historians such as Beard and Becker, these recent historians have put forward\narguments that deserve evaluation.\n❶The kind of conflict most emphasized by these historians is class conflict. ❷Yet with the Revolutionary War\ndominating these years, how does one distinguish class conflict within that larger conflict? ❸Certainly not by\nthe side a person supported. ❹Although many of these historians have accepted the earlier assumption that\nLoyalists represented an upper class, new evidence indicates that Loyalists, like rebels, were drawn from all\nsocioeconomic classes. ❺ (It is nonetheless probably true that a larger percentage of the well-to-do joined the\nLoyalists than joined the rebels.) ❻Looking at the rebel side, we find little evidence for the contention that\nlower-class rebels were in conflict with upper-class rebels. ❼Indeed, the war effort against Britain tended to\nsuppress class conflicts. ❽Where it did not, the disputing rebels of one or another class usually became\nLoyalists. ❾Loyalism thus operated as a safety valve to remove socioeconomic discontent that existed among\nthe rebels. ❿Disputes occurred, of course, among those who remained on the rebel side, but the extraordinary\nsocial mobility of eighteenth-century American society (with the obvious exception of slaves) usually prevented\nsuch disputes from hardening along class lines. 11Social\nstructure was in fact so fluid—though recent statistics\n○\nsuggest a narrowing of economic opportunity as the latter half of the century progressed—that to talk about\nsocial classes at all requires the use of loose economic categories such as rich, poor, and middle class, or\neighteenth-century designations like ―the better sort.‖ 12Despite\nthese vague categories, one should not claim\n○\nunequivocally that hostility between recognizable classes cannot be legitimately observed. 13Outside\nof New\n○\nYork, however, there were very few instances of openly expressed class antagonism.\n❶Having said this, however, one must add that there is much evidence to support the further claim of recent\nhistorians that sectional conflicts were common between 1763 and 1789. ❷The ―Paxton Boys‖ incident and the\nRegulator movement are representative examples of the widespread, and justified, discontent of western settlers\nagainst colonial or state governments dominated by eastern interests. ❸Although undertones of class conflict\nexisted beneath such hostility, the opposition was primarily geographical. ❹Sectional conflict—which also\nexisted between North and South—deserves further investigation.\n❶In summary, historians must be careful about the kind of conflict they emphasize in eighteenth-century\nAmerica. ❷Yet those who stress the achievement of a general consensus among the colonists cannot fully\nunderstand that consensus without understanding the conflicts that had to be overcome or repressed in order to\nreach it.\n\n\f17.
