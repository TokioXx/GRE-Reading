{"title":"心理历史学在取代传统历史学研究的同时本身也有缺陷","passage":"51\n❶Traditionally, the study of history has had fixed boundaries and focal points—periods, countries,\ndramatic events, and great leaders. ❷It also has had clear and firm notions of scholarly procedure: how one\ninquires into a historical problem, how one presents and documents one‘s findings, what constitutes admissible\nand adequate proof.\n❶Anyone who has followed recent historical literature can testify to the revolution that is taking place in\nhistorical studies. ❷The currently fashionable subjects come directly from the sociology catalog: childhood,\nwork, leisure. ❸The new subjects are accompanied by new methods. ❹Where history once was primarily\nnarrative, it is now entirely analytic. ❺The old questions ―What happened?‖ and ―How did it happen?‖ have\ngiven way to the question ―Why did it happen?‖ ❻Prominent among the methods used to answer the question\n―Why‖ is psychoanalysis, and its use has given rise to psychohistory.\n❶Psychohistory does not merely use psychological explanations in historical contexts. ❷Historians have\nalways used such explanations when they were appropriate and when there was sufficient evidence for them.\n❸But this pragmatic use of psychology is not what psychohistorians intend. ❹They are committed, not just to\npsychology in general, but to Freudian psychoanalysis. ❺This commitment precludes a commitment to history\nas historians have always understood it. ❻Psychohistory derives its ―facts‖ not from history, the detailed\nrecords of events and their consequences, but from psychoanalysis of the individuals who made history, and\ndeduces its theories not from this or that instance in their lives, but from a view of human nature that transcends\nhistory. ❼It denies the basic criterion of historical evidence: that evidence be publicly accessible to, and\ntherefore assessable by, all historians. ❽And it violates the basic tenet of historical method: that historians be\nalert to the negative instances that would refute their theses. ❾Psychohistorians, convinced of the absolute\nrightness of their own theories, are also convinced that theirs is the ―deepest‖ explanation of any event, and that\nother explanations fall short of the truth.\n❶Psychohistory is not content to violate the discipline of history (in the sense of the proper mode of\nstudying and writing about the past); it also violates the past itself. ❷It denies to the past an integrity and will of\nits own, in which people acted out of a variety of motives and in which events had a multiplicity of causes and\neffects. ❸It imposes upon the past the same determinism that it imposes upon the present, thus robbing people\nand events of their individuality and of their complexity. ❹Instead of respecting the particularity of the past, it\nassimilates all events, past and present, into a single deterministic schema that is presumed to be true at all times\nand in all circumstances.\n\n\f20. Which of the following best states the main point of the passage?\n(A) The approach of psychohistorians to historical study is currently in vogue even though it lacks the rigor\nand verifiability of traditional historical method.\n(B) Traditional historians can benefit from studying the techniques and findings of psychohistorians.\n(C) Areas of sociological study such as childhood and work are of little interest to traditional historians.\n(D) The psychological assessment of an individual‘s behavior and attitudes is more informative than the\ndetails of his or her daily life.\n(E) History is composed of unique and nonrepeating events that must be individually analyzed on the basis\nof publicly verifiable evidence.\n","questions":[{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that one way in which traditional history can be distinguished from\npsychohistory is that traditional history usually\n","options":["views past events as complex and having their own individuality\n","relies on a single interpretation of human behavior to explain historical events\n","interprets historical events in such a way that their specific nature is transcended\n","turns to psychological explanations in historical contexts to account for events\n","relies strictly on data that are concrete and quantifiable\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the methods used by psychohistorians probably prevent them from\n","options":["presenting their material in chronological order\n","producing a one-sided picture of an individual‘s personality and motivations\n","uncovering alternative explanations that might cause them to question their own conclusions\n","offering a consistent interpretation of the impact of personality on historical events\n","recognizing connections between a government‘s political actions and the aspirations of government\nleaders\n"]},{"subject":" The passage supplies information for answering which of the following questions?\n","options":["What are some specific examples of the use of psychohistory in historical interpretation?\n","When were the conventions governing the practice of traditional history first established?\n","When do traditional historians consider psychological explanations of historical developments\nappropriate?\n","What sort of historical figure is best suited for psychohistorical analysis?\n","What is the basic criterion of historical evidence required by traditional historians?\n"]},{"subject":" The author mentions which of the following as a characteristic of the practice of psychohistorians?\n","options":["The lives of historical figures are presented in episodic rather than narrative form.\n","Archives used by psychohistorians to gather material are not accessible to other scholars.\n","Past and current events are all placed within the same deterministic schema.\n","Events in the adult life of a historical figure are seen to be more consequential than are those in the\nchildhood of the figure.\n","Analysis is focused on group behavior rather than on particular events in an individual‘s life.\n"]},{"subject":" The author of the passage suggests that psychohistorians view history primarily as\n\n\f(A) a report of events, causes, and effects that is generally accepted by historians but which is, for the most\npart, unverifiable\n","options":["an episodic account that lacks cohesion because records of the role of childhood, work, and leisure in\nthe lives of historical figures are rare\n","an uncharted sea of seemingly unexplainable events that have meaning only when examined as discrete\nunits\n","a record of the way in which a closed set of immutable psychological laws seems to have shaped events\n","a proof of the existence of intricate causal interrelationships between past and present events\n"]},{"subject":" The author of the passage puts the word ―deepest‖ (in the highlighted portion) in quotation marks most\nprobably in order to\n","options":["signal her reservations about the accuracy of psychohistorians‘ claims for their work\n","draw attention to a contradiction in the psychohistorians‘ method\n","emphasize the major difference between the traditional historians‘ method and that of psychohistorians\n","disassociate her opinion of the psychohistorians‘ claims from her opinion of their method\n","question the usefulness of psychohistorians‘ insights into traditional historical scholarship\n"]},{"subject":" In presenting her analysis, the author does all of the following EXCEPT:\n","options":["Make general statement without reference to specific examples.\n","Describe some of the criteria employed by traditional historians.\n","Question the adequacy of the psychohistorians‘ interpretation of events.\n","Point out inconsistencies in the psychohistorians‘ application of their methods.\n","Contrast the underlying assumptions of psychohistorians with those of traditional historians.\n\n\f"]}]}
