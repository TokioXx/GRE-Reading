{"title":"Tolstoi的作品是单纯朴素的","passage":"47\n❶ “Masterpieces are dumb,” wrote Flaubert, “They have a tranquil aspect like the very products of\nnature, like large animals and mountains.” ❷He might have been thinking of War and Peace, that vast, silent\nwork, unfathomable and simple, provoking endless questions through the majesty of its being. ❸Tolstoi‘s\nsimplicity is ―overpowering,‖ says the critic Bayley, ―disconcerting,‖ because it comes from ―his casual\nassumption that the world is as he sees it.‖ ❹Like other nineteenth-century Russian writers he is ―impressive‖\nbecause he ―means what he says,‖ but he stands apart from all others and from most Western writers in his\nidentity with life, which is so complete as to make us forget he is an artist. ❺He is the center of his work, but\nhis egocentricity is of a special kind. ❻Goethe, for example, says Bayley, “cared for nothing but himself.\nTolstoi was nothing but himself.”\n❶For all his varied modes of writing and the multiplicity of characters in his fiction, Tolstoi and his work\nare of a piece. ❷The famous ―conversion‖ of his middle years, movingly recounted in his Confession, was a\nculmination of his early spiritual life, not a departure from it. ❸The apparently fundamental changes that led\nfrom epic narrative to dogmatic parable, from a joyous, buoyant attitude toward life to pessimism and cynicism,\nfrom War and Peace to The Kreutzer Sonata, came from the same restless, impressionable depths of an\nindependent spirit yearning to get at the truth of its experience. ❹ ―Truth is my hero,‖ wrote Tolstoi in his youth,\nreporting the fighting in Sebastopol. ❺Truth remained his hero—his own, not others‘, truth. ❻Others were\nawed by Napoleon, believed that a single man could change the destinies of nations, adhered to meaningless\nrituals, formed their tastes on established canons of art. ❼Tolstoi reversed all preconceptions; and in every\nreversal he overthrew the ―system,‖ the ―machine,‖ the externally ordained belief, the conventional behavior in\nfavor of unsystematic, impulsive life, of inward motivation and the solutions of independent thought.\n❶In his work the artificial and the genuine are always exhibited in dramatic opposition: the supposedly\ngreat Napoleon and the truly great, unregarded little Captain Tushin, or Nicholas Rostov‘s actual experience in\nbattle and his later account of it. ❷The simple is always pitted against the elaborate, knowledge gained from\nobservation against assertions of borrowed faiths. ❸Tolstoi’s magical simplicity is a product of these tensions;\nhis work is a record of the questions he put to himself and of the answers he found in his search. ❹The greatest\ncharacters of his fiction exemplify this search, and their happiness depends on the measure of their answers. ❺\nTolstoi wanted happiness, but only hard-won happiness, that emotional fulfillment and intellectual clarity which\ncould come only as the prize of all-consuming effort. ❻He scorned lesser satisfactions.\n\n\f21.
