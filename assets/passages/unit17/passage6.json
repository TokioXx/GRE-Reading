{"title":"人们很难研究太阳活动周期","passage":"52\n❶It has been known for many decades that the appearance of sunspots is roughly periodic, with an average\ncycle of eleven years. ❷Moreover, the incidence of solar flares and the flux of solar cosmic rays, ultraviolet\nradiation, and x-radiation all vary directly with the sunspot cycle. ❸ But after more than a century of\ninvestigation, the relation of these and other phenomena, known collectively as the solar-activity cycle, to\nterrestrial weather and climate remains unclear. ❹For example, the sunspot cycle and the allied\nmagnetic-polarity cycle have been linked to periodicities discerned in records of such variables as rainfall,\ntemperature, and winds. ❺Invariably, however, the relation is weak, and commonly of dubious statistical\nsignificance.\n\n❶Effects of solar variability over longer terms have also been sought. ❷The absence of recorded sunspot\nactivity in the notes kept by European observers in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries has led\nsome scholars to postulate a brief cessation of sunspot activity at that time (a period called the Maunder\nminimum). ❸The Maunder minimum has been linked to a span of unusual cold in Europe extending from the\nsixteenth to the early nineteenth centuries. ❹The reality of the Maunder minimum has yet to be established,\nhowever, especially since the records that Chinese naked-eye observers of solar activity made at that time appear\nto contradict it. ❺Scientists have also sought evidence of long-term solar periodicities by examining indirect\nclimatological data, such as fossil records of the thickness of ancient tree rings. ❻These studies, however, failed\nto link unequivocally terrestrial climate and the solar-activity cycle, or even to confirm the cycle‘s past\nexistence.\n\n❶If consistent and reliable geological or archaeological evidence tracing the solar-activity cycle in the distant\npast could be found, it might also resolve an important issue in solar physics: how to model solar activity.\n❷Currently, there are two models of solar activity. ❸The first supposes that the Sun’s internal motions\n(caused by rotation and convection) interact with its large-scale magnetic field to produce a dynamo, a\ndevice in which mechanical energy is converted into the energy of a magnetic field. ❹In short, the Sun‘s\nlarge-scale magnetic field is taken to be self-sustaining, so that the solar-activity cycle it drives would be\nmaintained with little overall change for perhaps billions of years. ❺The alternative explanation supposes that\nthe Sun‘s large-scale magnetic field is a remnant of the field the Sun acquired when it formed, and is not\nsustained against decay. ❻In this model, the solar mechanism dependent on the Sun‘s magnetic field runs down\nmore quickly. ❼Thus, the characteristics of the solar-activity cycle could be expected to change over a long\nperiod of time. ❽Modern solar observations span too short a time to reveal whether present cyclical solar\nactivity is a long-lived feature of the Sun, or merely a transient phenomenon.\n\n\f17.
