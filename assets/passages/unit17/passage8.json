{"title":"利用Vostok冰芯的数据，科学家了解了大气的构成与全球气温变化的关系","passage":"54\n❶Aided by the recent ability to analyze samples of air trapped in glaciers, scientists now have a clearer idea of\nthe relationship between atmospheric composition and global temperature change over the past 160,000 years.\n❷In particular, determination of atmospheric composition during periods of glacial expansion and retreat\n(cooling and warming) is possible using data from the 2,000 meter Vostok ice core drilled in Antarctica. ❸The\ntechnique involved is similar to that used in analyzing cores of marine sediments, where the ratio of the two\ncommon isotopes of oxygen, 18O and 16O, accurately reflects past temperature changes. ❹Isotopic analysis of\noxygen in the Vostok core suggests mean global temperature fluctuations of up to 10 degrees centigrade over the\npast 160,000 years.\n❶Data from the Vostok core also indicate that the amount of carbon dioxide has fluctuated with temperature\nover the same period: the higher the temperature, the higher the concentration of carbon dioxide and the lower\nthe temperature, the lower the concentration. ❷Although change in carbon dioxide content closely follows\nchange in temperature during periods of deglaciation, it apparently lags behind temperature during periods of\ncooling. ❸The correlation of carbon dioxide with temperature, of course, does not establish whether changes in\natmospheric composition caused the warming and cooling trends or were caused by their.\n❶The correlation between carbon dioxide and temperature throughout the Vostok record is consistent and\npredictable. ❷The absolute temperature changes, however, are from 5 to 14 times greater than would be\nexpected on the basis of carbon dioxide‘s own ability to absorb infrared radiation, or radiant heat. ❸This\nreaction suggests that, quite aside from changes in heat-trapping gases, commonly known as greenhouse gases,\ncertain positive feedbacks are also amplifying the temperature change. ❹Such feedbacks might involve ice on\nland and sea, clouds, or water vapor, which also absorb radiant heat.\n❶Other data from the Vostok core show that methane gas also correlates closely with temperature and carbon\ndioxide. ❷The methane concentration nearly doubled, for example, between the peak of the penultimate glacial\nperiod and the following interglacial period. ❸Within the present interglacial period it has more than doubled in\njust the past 300 years and is rising rapidly. ❹Although the concentration of atmospheric methane is more than\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than that of carbon dioxide, it cannot be ignored: the radiative properties of\nmethane make it 20 times more effective, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide in absorbing radiant heat.\n❺On the basis of a simulation model that climatological researchers have developed, methane appears to have\nbeen about 25 percent as important as carbon dioxide in the warming that took place during the most recent\nglacial retreat 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.\n\n\f17.
