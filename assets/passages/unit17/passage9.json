{"title":"认识论的发展，使哲学成为独立、基础的学科","passage":"55\n❶Present-day philosophers usually envision their discipline as an endeavor that has been, since antiquity,\ndistinct from and superior to any particular intellectual discipline, such as theology or science. ❷Such\nphilosophical concerns as the mind-body problem or, more generally, the nature of human knowledge,\nthey believe, are basic human questions whose tentative philosophical solutions have served as the\nnecessary foundations on which all other intellectual speculation has rested.\n❶The basis for this view, however, lies in a serious misinterpretation of the past, a projection of modern\nconcerns onto past events. ❷The idea of an autonomous discipline called “philosophy,” distinct from and\nsitting in judgment on such pursuits as theology and science turns out, on close examination, to be of quite\nrecent origin. ❸When, in the seventeenth century, Descartes and Hobbes rejected medieval philosophy,\nthey did not think of themselves, as modern philosophers do, as proposing a new and better philosophy,\nbut rather as furthering “the warfare between science and theology” . ❹They were fighting, albeit\ndiscreetly, to open the intellectual world to the new science and to liberate intellectual life from\necclesiastical philosophy and envisioned their work as contributing to the growth, not of philosophy, but\nof research in mathematics and physics. ❺This link between philosophical interests and scientific\npractice persisted until the nineteenth century, when decline in ecclesiastical power over scholarship and\nchanges in the nature of science provoked the final separation of philosophy from both.\n❶The demarcation of philosophy from science was facilitated by the development in the early nineteenth\ncentury of a new notion, that philosophy’s core interest should be epistemology, the general explanation\nof what it means to know something. ❷Modern philosophers now trace that notion back at least to\nDescartes and Spinoza, but it was not explicitly articulated until the late eighteenth century, by Kant, and\ndid not become built into the structure of academic institutions and the standard self-descriptions of\nphilosophy professors until the late nineteenth century. ❸Without the idea of epistemology, the survival\nof philosophy in an age of modern science is hard to imagine. ❹Metaphysics, philosophy’s traditional\ncore—considered as the most general description of how the heavens and the earth are put together—had\nbeen rendered almost completely meaningless by the spectacular progress of physics. ❺Kant, however,\nby focusing philosophy on the problem of knowledge, managed to replace metaphysics with epistemology,\nand thus to transform the notion of philosophy as “queen of sciences” into the new notion of philosophy as\na separate, foundational discipline. ❻Philosophy became “primary” no longer in the sense of “highest” but\nin the sense of “underlying”. ❼After Kant, philosophers were able to reinterpret seventeenth-and\neighteenth-century thinkers as attempting to discover “How is our knowledge possible?” and to project\nthis question back even on the ancients.\n\n\f17.
