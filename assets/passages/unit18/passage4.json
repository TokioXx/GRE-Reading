{"title":"铅元素同位素含量对解读青铜时代的考古记录有帮助","passage":"60\n❶The determination of the sources of copper ore used in the manufacture of copper and bronze artifacts of\nBronze Age civilizations would add greatly to our knowledge of cultural contacts and trade in that era.\n❷Researchers have analyzed artifacts and ores for their concentrations of elements, but for a variety of reasons,\nthese studies have generally failed to provide evidence of the sources of the copper used in the objects.\n❸Elemental composition can vary within the same copper-ore lode, usually because of varying admixtures of\nother elements, especially iron, lead, zinc, and arsenic. ❹And high concentrations of cobalt or zinc, noticed in\nsome artifacts, appear in a variety of copper-ore sources. ❺Moreover, the processing of ores introduced poorly\ncontrolled changes in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the resulting metal. ❻Some elements\nevaporate during smelting and roasting; different temperatures and processes produce different degrees of loss.\n❼Finally, flux, which is sometimes added during smelting to remove waste material from the ore, could\nadd quantities of elements to the final product.\n\n❶An elemental property that is unchanged through these chemical processes is the isotopic composition of each\nmetallic element in the ore. ❷Isotopic composition, the percentages of the different isotopes of an element in a\ngiven sample of the element, is therefore particularly suitable as an indicator of the sources of the ore. ❸Of\ncourse, for this purpose it is necessary to find an element whose isotopic composition is more or less constant\nthroughout a given ore body, but varies from one copper ore body to another or, at least, from one geographic\nregion to another.\n\n❶The ideal choice, when isotopic composition is used to investigate the source of copper ore, would seem to be\ncopper itself. ❷It has been shown that small but measurable variations occur naturally in the isotopic\ncomposition of copper. ❸However, the variations are large enough only in rare ores; between samples of the\ncommon ore minerals of copper, isotopic variations greater than the measurement error have not been found.\n❹An alternative choice is lead, which occurs in most copper and bronze artifacts of the Bronze Age in amounts\nconsistent with the lead being derived from the copper ores and possibly from the fluxes. ❺The isotopic\ncomposition of lead often varies from one source of common copper ore to another, with variations exceeding\nthe measurement error; and preliminary studies indicate virtually uniform isotopic composition of the lead from\na single copper-ore source. ❻While some of the lead found in an artifact may have been introduced from flux or\nwhen other metals were added to the copper ore, lead so added in Bronze Age processing would usually have the\nsame isotopic composition as the lead in the copper ore. ❼Lead isotope studies may thus prove useful for\ninterpreting the archaeological record of the Bronze Age.\n\n\f21.
