{"title":"actos剧作以及Teatro Campesino的重要性","passage":"61\n❶ In the fields of Delano, California, in 1965, Luis Valdez started the Teatro Campesino (Farmworker‘s\nTheater), and with it initiated the renaissance of Mexican American theater. ❷The Teatro Campesino had an\navowedly political purpose: to rally campesinos (farmworkers) in support of the farm workers‘ strike then being\norganized by Cesar Chavez. ❸Valdez‘ dramatic presentations, called actos, spoke to a campesino audience and\naddressed topics and themes directly related to the strike. ❹Valdez‘ early actos were composed of a series of\nscenes about the strike experience acted by campesino volunteers. ❺His later actos were presented by a newly\nconstituted professional company, still called the Teatro Campesino, and addressed such themes as the impact of\nthe Vietnam War on Mexican Americans and the dangers of assimilation, themes relevant to urban Mexican\nAmericans as well as to campesinos. ❻All Valdez‘ actos contained elements of song and dance, relied little on\nstage effects or props, and featured the use of masks. ❼These dramatic elements, along with an intensely social\nor political purpose and the use of a mixture of Spanish, English, and Mexican American dialects in the\ndialogues, which realistically capture the flavor of Mexican American conversation, are still characteristic both\nof the acto and of most other forms of Mexican American theater today.\n❶Innovative as it is, the acto owes much to the theater traditions of other periods and regions. ❷Like\nearly Spanish American religious dramas, secular folk dramas, and the Mexican carpas of a somewhat later\nperiod, actos are usually performed outdoors by traveling groups of players or by local theater groups. ❸The\nimprovised comic satire of the actos is often attributed to Valdez‘ study of the Italian commedia dell’ arte of the\nsixteenth century, although some critics see it as a direct reflection of the comic and improvisational\nqualities of the more contemporary and local carpas of Mexican theater. ❹The Italian influence is likely,\nwhatever Valdez immediate source: the Mexican carpas themselves are said to have originated from the theater\npieces of a sixteenth-century Spanish writer inspired by encounters with Italian commedia dell’ arte troupes on\ntour in Spain. ❺The English-language theater has provided elements as well: Valdez himself has acknowledged\nhis debt to the agitprop socialist theater that appeared in the United States during the 1920‘s and 1930‘s. ❻In\nparticular, his actos contain the same assortment of semiallegorical characters and the same blend of music,\nchorus, and dialogue found in some of the agitprop pieces, as well as the same fierce spirit of social and political\ncritique. ❼Finally, many of Valdez‘ later theater pieces freely incorporate characters, plots and symbols drawn\nfrom the indigenous myths and rituals of the pre-Hispanic peoples of Latin America. ❽In fact, no other art form\nillustrates more clearly the depth and complexity of the Mexican American heritage itself than does the acto of\nLuis Valdez and the Teatro Campesino.\n\n\f21. According to the passage, the original impetus behind the establishment of the Teatro Campesino was which\nof the following?\n(A) To help urban Mexican Americans understand the problems confronting striking campesinos in\nCalifornia\n(B) To promote an attitude of pride in the depth and richness of the Mexican American heritage among\nstriking campesinos\n(C) To provide striking campesinos an opportunity to use their creative talents to express their political\nopinions\n(D) To allow its founder to express his personal support of the campesinos’ strike effort\n(E) To mobilize campesinos to support the farm workers‘ strike in California\n","questions":[{"subject":" The author cites all of the following as probable influences on Valdez‘ development of the acto EXCEPT the\n","options":["theater of sixteenth-century Italy\n","carpas of Mexico\n","drama of classical Greece\n","English-language theater of the United States\n","myths and rituals of pre-Hispanic America\n"]},{"subject":" The passage suggests that which of the following was true of the later actos of the Teatro Campesino?\n","options":["They were more politically effective than were earlier actos.\n","They were presented primarily outdoors, whereas earlier actos were presented inside theaters.\n","They used a greater mixture of dialects than did the earlier actos.\n","They addressed a broader audience than did the earlier actos.\n","They differed from earlier actos in that they contained fewer improvisational elements.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following best describes the author‘s evaluation of the views of the critics cited in the\nhighlighted portion?\n","options":["Their views, if correct, do not preclude the existence of an Italian influence on the acto.\n","Their views are unlikely to be correct, given the differences existing between Mexican and Mexican\n","merican theater.\n","Their views concerning the Mexican carpas are essentially correct, but they lack familiarity with the\nacto.\n","Their views are probably more correct than the views of those who have attributed the comic and\nimprovisational elements of the acto to earlier sources.\n","Their views betray a lack of familiarity with the commedia dell’ arte.\n"]},{"subject":" The passage suggests that which of the following explains the characteristic use of a mixture of Spanish,\n","options":["nglish, and Mexican American dialects in the works of Mexican American playwrights?\n","Mexican American playwrights wish to include in their works elements drawn from the traditions and\nhistory of pre-Hispanic America.\n","Mexican American playwrights try to guarantee that their works are fully understood by the broadest\npossible audience, including those who may speak only one language.\n\n\f(C) Such a linguistic mix faithfully reflects the linguistic diversity of Mexican American culture, and is\neasily understood by most Mexican Americans.\n","Many Mexican American playwrights are quite familiar with both the Spanish-language and the\n","nglish-language theater traditions.\n","Many different languages are still spoken within the confines of the United States, although English is\nstill the most common first language of its citizens.\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, which of the following elements characteristic of the acto are also found in some\nagitprop theater pieces?\n","options":["The use of masks\n","Comic improvisation\n","An outdoor setting\n","Minimal use of complex stage effects or props\n","An assortment of semiallegorical characters\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the author‘s argument concerning the debt of the acto to\nthe theater traditions of other periods and regions?\n","options":["Many popular forms of theater rely heavily on improvisation.\n","Plays resembling the acto in structure were written in the 1970‘s by West African playwrights who are\ninterested in dramatizing the richness of their own cultures.\n","The use of masks has, at one time or another, been characteristic of the theater traditions of almost all\ncultures, even those most isolated from outside influences.\n","During a strike, it is common for union members to present musical skits dramatizing the values of\nsolidarity and resistance.\n","Before 1965 Luis Valdez had attended many performances of traditional Mexican theater groups touring\nthe western United States.\n\n\f"]}]}
