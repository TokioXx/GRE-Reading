{"title":"通过对兔子的研究来理解LDL受体与LDL之间的联系","passage":"66\n❶For some time scientists have believed that cholesterol plays a major role in heart disease because people\nwith familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic defect, have six to eight times the normal level of cholesterol in\ntheir blood and they invariably develop heart disease. ❷These people lack cell-surface receptors for low-density\nlipoproteins (LDL‘s), which are the fundamental carriers of blood cholesterol to the body cells that use\ncholesterol. ❸Without an adequate number of cell-surface receptors to remove LDL‘s from the blood, the\ncholesterol-carrying LDL‘s remain in the blood, increasing blood cholesterol levels. ❹Scientists also noticed\nthat people with familial hypercholesterolemia appear to produce more LDL‘s than normal individuals. ❺How,\nscientists wondered, could a genetic mutation that causes a slowdown in the removal of LDL‘s from the blood\nalso result in an increase in the synthesis of this cholesterol-carrying protein?\n❶Since scientists could not experiment on human body tissue, their knowledge of familial\nhypercholesterolemia was severely limited. ❷However, a breakthrough came in the laboratories of Yoshio\nWatanabe of Kobe University in Japan in 1980. ❸Watanabe noticed that a male rabbit in his colony had ten\ntimes the normal concentration of cholesterol in its blood. ❹By appropriate breeding, Watanabe obtained a\nstrain of rabbits that had very high cholesterol levels. ❺These rabbits spontaneously developed heart disease.\n❻To his surprise, Watanabe further found that the rabbits, like humans with familial hypercholesterolemia,\nlacked LDL receptors. ❼Thus, scientists could study these Watanabe rabbits to gain a better understanding of\nfamilial hypercholesterolemia in humans.\n❶Prior to the breakthrough at Kobe University, it was known that LDL‘s are secreted from the liver in the\nform of a precursor, called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL‘s), which carry triglycerides as well as\nrelatively small amounts of cholesterol. ❷The triglycerides are removed from the VLDL‘s by fatty and other\ntissues. ❸What remains is a remnant particle that must be removed from the blood. ❹What scientists learned\nby studying the Watanabe rabbits is that the removal of the VLDL remnant requires the LDL receptor.\n❺Normally, the majority of the VLDL remnants go to the liver where they bind to LDL receptors and are\ndegraded. ❻In the Watanabe rabbit, due to a lack of LDL receptors on liver cells, the VLDL remnants remain in\nthe blood and are eventually converted to LDL‘s. ❼The LDL receptors thus have a dual effect in controlling\nLDL levels. ❽They are necessary to prevent oversynthesis of LDL‘s from VLDL remnants and they are\nnecessary for the normal removal of LDL‘s from the blood. ❾With this knowledge, scientists are now well on\nthe way toward developing drugs that dramatically lower cholesterol levels in people afflicted with certain forms\nof familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\n\f17.
