{"title":"树木自身的防御机制反而让树木更容易受到毛毛虫的威胁","passage":"63\n❶The defoliation of millions of acres of trees by massive infestations of gypsy moth caterpillars is a recurring\nphenomenon in the northeastern United States. ❷In studying these outbreaks, scientists have discovered that\naffected trees fight back by releasing toxic chemicals, mainly phenols, into their foliage. ❸These noxious\nsubstances limit caterpillars‘ growth and reduce the number of eggs that female moths lay. ❹Phenols also make\nthe eggs smaller, which reduces the growth of the following year‘s caterpillars. ❺Because the number of eggs a\nfemale moth produces is directly related to her size, and because her size is determined entirely by her feeding\nsuccess as a caterpillar, the trees’ defensive mechanism has an impact on moth fecundity.\n\n❶The gypsy moth is also subject to attack by the nucleopolyhedrosis virus, or wilt disease, a particularly\nimportant killer of the caterpillars in outbreak years. ❷Caterpillars contract wilt disease when they eat a leaf to\nwhich the virus, encased in a protein globule, has become attached. ❸Once ingested by a caterpillar, the protein\nglobule dissolves, releasing thousands of viruses, or virions, that after about two weeks multiply enough to fill\nthe entire body cavity. ❹When the caterpillar dies, the virions are released to the outside, encased in a new\nprotein globule synthesized from the caterpillar‘s tissues and ready to be picked up by other caterpillars.\n\n❶Knowing that phenols, including tannins, often act by associating with and altering the activity of proteins,\nresearchers focused on the effects on caterpillars of ingesting the virus and leaves together. ❷They found that\non tannin-rich oak leaves, the virus is considerably less effective at killing caterpillars than when it is on aspen\nleaves, which are lower in phenols. ❸In general, the more concentrated the phenols in tree leaves, the less\ndeadly the virus. ❹Thus, while highly concentrated phenols in tree leaves reduce the caterpillar population by\nlimiting the size of caterpillars and, consequently, the size of the female‘s egg cluster, these same chemicals also\nhelp caterpillars survive by disabling the wilt virus. ❺Forest stands of red oaks, with their tannin-rich foliage,\nmay even provide caterpillars with safe havens from disease. ❻In stands dominated by trees such as aspen,\nhowever, incipient gypsy moth outbreaks are quickly suppressed by viral epidemics.\n\n❶Further research has shown that caterpillars become virtually immune to the wilt virus as the trees on which\nthey feed respond to increasing defoliation. ❷The trees‘ own defenses raise the threshold of caterpillar\nvulnerability to the disease, allowing populations to grow denser without becoming more susceptible to infection.\n❸For these reasons, the benefits to the caterpillars of ingesting phenols appear to outweigh the costs. ❹Given\nthe presence of the virus, the trees‘ defensive tactic apparently has backfired.\n\n\f17.
