{"title":"关于消费者革命仍存在三个没有被很好解决的问题","passage":"58\n❶Historians have only recently begun to note the increase in demand for luxury goods and services that took\nplace in eighteenth-century England. ❷McKendrick has explored the Wedgwood firm‘s remarkable success in\nmarketing luxury pottery; Plumb has written about the proliferation of provincial theaters, musical festivals, and\nchildren‘s toys and books. ❸While the fact of this consumer revolution is hardly in doubt, three key questions\nremain: Who were the consumers? What were their motives? And what were the effects of the new demand for\nluxuries?\n\n❶An answer to the first of these has been difficult to obtain. ❷Although it has been possible to infer from the\ngoods and services actually produced what manufactures and servicing trades thought their customers wanted,\nonly a study of relevant personal documents written by actual consumers will provide a precise picture of who\nwanted what. ❸We still need to know how large this consumer market was and how far down the social scale\nthe consumer demand for luxury goods penetrated. ❹With regard to this last question, we might note in passing\nthat Thompson, while rightly restoring laboring people to the stage of eighteenth-century English history, has\nprobably exaggerated the opposition of these people to the inroads of capitalist consumerism in general; for\nexample, laboring people in eighteenth-century England readily shifted from home-brewed beer to standardized\nbeer produced by huge, heavily capitalized urban breweries.\n\n❶To answer the question of why consumers became so eager to buy, some historians have pointed to the ability\nof manufacturers to advertise in a relatively uncensored press. ❷This, however, hardly seems a sufficient\nanswer. ❸McKendrick favors a Veblen model of conspicuous consumption stimulated by competition for status.\n❹The ―middling sort‖ bought goods and services because they wanted to follow fashions set by the rich.\n❺Again, we may wonder whether this explanation is sufficient. ❻Do not people enjoy buying things as a form\nof self-gratification? ❼If so, consumerism could be seen as a product of the rise of new concepts of\nindividualism and materialism, but not necessarily of the frenzy for conspicuous competition.\n\n❶Finally, what were the consequences of this consumer demand for luxuries? ❷McKendrick claims that it\ngoes a long way toward explaining the coming of the Industrial Revolution. ❸But does it? ❹What, for\nexample, does the production of high-quality pottery and toys have to do with the development of iron\nmanufacture or textile mills? ❺It is perfectly possible to have the psychology and reality of a consumer society\nwithout a heavy industrial sector.\n❶That future exploration of these key questions is undoubtedly necessary should not, however, diminish the\nforce of the conclusion of recent studies: the insatiable demand in eighteenth-century England for frivolous as\nwell as useful goods and services foreshadows our own world.\n\n\f17.
