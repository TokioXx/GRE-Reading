{"title":"shergottites起源于火星","passage":"9\n❶Of the thousands of specimens of meteorites found on Earth and known to science, only about 100 are\nigneous; that is, they have undergone melting by volcanic action at some time since the planets were first formed.\n❷These igneous meteorites are known as achondrites because they lack chondrules—small stony spherules\nfound in the thousands of meteorites (called ―chondrites‖) composed primarily of unaltered minerals that\ncondensed from dust and gas at the origin of the solar system. ❸Achondrites are the only known samples of\nvolcanic rocks originating outside the Earth-Moon system. ❹Most are thought to have been dislodged by\ninterbody impact from asteroids, with diameters of from 10 to 500 kilometers, in solar orbit between Mars and\nJupiter.\n❶Shergottites, the name given to three anomalous achondrites so far discovered on Earth, present scientists\nwith a genuine enigma. ❷Shergottites crystallized from molten rock less than 1.1 billion years ago (some 3.5\nbillion years later than typical achondrites) and were presumably ejected into space when an object impacted on\na body similar in chemical composition to Earth.\n\n❶While most meteorites appear to derive from comparatively small bodies, shergottites exhibit properties that\nindicate that their source was a large planet, conceivably Mars. ❷In order to account for such an unlikely source,\nsome unusual factor must be invoked, because the impact needed to accelerate a fragment of rock to escape the\ngravitational field of a body even as small as the Moon is so great that no meteorites of lunar origin have been\ndiscovered.\n\n❶While some scientists speculate that shergottites derive from Io (a volcanically active moon of Jupiter), recent\nmeasurements suggest that since Io‘s surface is rich in sulfur and sodium, the chemical composition of its\nvolcanic products would probably be unlike that of the shergottites. ❷Moreover, any fragments dislodged from\nIo by interbody impact would be unlikely to escape the gravitational pull of Jupiter.\n\n❶The only other logical source of shergottites is Mars. ❷Space-probe photographs indicate the existence of\ngiant volcanoes on the Martian surface. ❸From the small number of impact craters that appear on Martian lava\nflows, one can estimate that the planet was volcanically active as recently as a half-billion years ago—and may\nbe active today. ❹The great objection to the Martian origin of shergottites is the absence of lunar meteorites on\nEarth. ❺An impact capable of ejecting a fragment of the Martian surface into an Earth-intersecting orbit is even\nless probable than such an event on the Moon, in view of the Moon‘s smaller size and closer proximity to Earth.\n❻A recent study suggests, however, that permafrost ices below the surface of Mars may have altered the effects\nof impact on it. ❼If the ices had been rapidly vaporized by an impacting object, the expanding gases might have\nhelped the ejected fragments reach escape velocity. ❽Finally, analyses performed by space probes show a\nremarkable chemical similarity between Martian soil and the shergottites.\n\n\f21.
