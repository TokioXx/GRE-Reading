{"title":"臭氧总量是自身分解和生成平衡的结果","passage":"09\n❶The stratospheric ozone layer is not a completely uniform stratum, nor does it occur at the same altitude\naround the globe. ❷It lies closest to the Earth over the poles and rises to maximum altitude over the equator.\n❸In the stratosphere, ozone is continuously being made and destroyed by natural processes. ❹During the day\nthe Sun breaks down some of the oxygen molecules to single oxygen atoms, and these reacting with the oxygen\nmolecules that have not been dissociated, form ozone. ❺However, the sunlight also breaks down ozone by\nconverting some of it back to normal oxygen. ❻In addition naturally occurring nitrogen oxides enter into the\ncycle and speed the breakdown reactions. ❼The amount of ozone present at any one time is the balance\nbetween the processes that create it and those that destroy it.\n\n❶Since the splitting of the oxygen molecules depends directly upon the intensity of solar radiation, the greatest\nrate of ozone production occurs over the tropics. ❷However ozone is also destroyed most rapidly there, and\nwind circulation patterns carry the ozone-enriched upper layers of the atmosphere away from the equator. ❸It\nturns out that the largest total ozone amounts are found at high latitudes. ❹On a typical day the amount of\nozone over Minnesota, for example, is 30 percent greater than the amount over Texas, 900 miles farther south.\n❺The density and altitude of the ozone layer also change with the seasons, the weather, and the amount of solar\nactivity. ❻Nevertheless, at any one place above the Earth‘s surface, the long-term averages maintained by\nnatural processes are believed to be reasonably constant.\n\n❶The amount of ozone near the Earth is only a small percent of the amount in the stratosphere, and exchange of\nmolecules between the ozone layer and the air at ground level is thought to be relatively small. ❷Furthermore,\nthe ozone molecule is so unstable that only a tiny fraction of ground-level ozone could survive the long trip to\nthe stratosphere, so the ozone layer will not be replenished to any significant degree by the increasing\nconcentrations of ozone that have been detected in recent years near the earth‘s surface. ❸The long-term\naverages of ozone both near ground level and in the stratosphere are regulated by continuous processes that are\nconstantly destroying and creating it in each of these places. ❹This is why scientists are so concerned about\nhuman beings injection into the stratosphere of chemicals like nitrogen oxides, which are catalysts that facilitate\nthe breakdown of ozone. ❺If the ozone layer is depleted significantly, more ultraviolet radiation would\npenetrate to the Earth‘s surface and damage many living organisms.\n\n\f17.
