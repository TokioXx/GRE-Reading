{"title":"肽类激素的形成方法和功能","passage":"14\nThis passage was adapted from an article published in 1982.\n❶Until about five years ago, the very idea that peptide hormones might be made anywhere in the brain besides\nthe hypothalamus was astounding. ❷Peptide hormones, scientists thought, were made by endocrine glands and\nthe hypothalamus was thought to be the brains‘ only endocrine gland. ❸What is more, because peptide\nhormones cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, researchers believed that they never got to any part of the brain\nother than the hypothalamus, where they were simply produced and then released into the bloodstream.\n\n❶But these beliefs about peptide hormones were questioned as laboratory after laboratory found that antiserums\nto peptide hormones, when injected into the brain, bind in places other than the hypothalamus, indicating that\neither the hormones or substances that cross-react with the antiserums are present. ❷The immunological\nmethod of detecting peptide hormones by means of antiserums, however, is imprecise. ❸Cross-reactions are\npossible and this method cannot determine whether the substances detected by the antiserums really are the\nhormones, or merely close relatives. ❹Furthermore, this method cannot be used to determine the location in the\nbody where the detected substances are actually produced.\n\n❶New techniques of molecular biology, however, provide a way to answer these questions. ❷It is possible to\nmake specific complementary DNA‘s (cDNA‘s) that can serve as molecular probes to seek out the messenger\nRNA‘s (mRNA‘s) of the peptide hormones. ❸If brain cells are making the hormones, the cells will contain\nthese mRNA‘s. ❹If the products the brain cells make resemble the hormones but are not identical to them, then\nthe cDNA‘s should still bind to these mRNA‘s, but should not bind as tightly as they would to mRNA‘s for the\ntrue hormones. ❺The cells containing these mRNA‘s can then be isolated and their mRNA‘s decoded to\ndetermine just what their protein products are and how closely the products resemble the true peptide hormones.\n\n❶The molecular approach to detecting peptide hormones using cDNA probes should also be much faster than\nthe immunological method because it can take years of tedious purifications to isolate peptide hormones and\nthen develop antiserums to them. ❷Roberts, expressing the sentiment of many researchers, states: ―I was trained\nas an endocrinologist. ❸But it became clear to me that the field of endocrinology needed molecular biology\ninput. ❹The process of grinding out protein purifications is just too slow.‖\n\n❶If, as the initial tests with cDNA probes suggest, peptide hormones really are made in the brain in areas other\nthan the hypothalamus, a theory must be developed that explains their function in the brain. ❷Some have\nsuggested that the hormones are all growth regulators, but Rosen‘s work on rat brains indicates that this cannot\nbe true. ❸A number of other researchers propose that they might be used for intercellular communication in the\nbrain.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" Which of the following titles best summarizes the
