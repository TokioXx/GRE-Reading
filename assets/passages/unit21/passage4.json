{"title":"军事上威慑因素的强化会给女性提供更多参与军事任务的机会","passage":"88\n(This passage is from an article published in 1973)\n❶The recent change to all-volunteer armed forces in the United States will eventually produce a gradual\nincrease in the proportion of women in the armed forces and in the variety of women‘s assignments, but probably\nnot the dramatic gains for women that might have been expected. ❷This is so even though the armed forces\noperate in an ethos of institutional change oriented toward occupational equality and under the federal sanction\nof equal pay for equal work. ❸The difficulty is that women are unlikely to be trained for any direct combat\noperations. ❹A significant portion of the larger society remains uncomfortable as yet with extending equality\nin this direction. ❺Therefore, for women in the military, the search for equality will still be based on functional\nequivalence, not identity or even similarity of task. ❻Opportunities seem certain to arise. ❼The growing\nemphasis on deterrence is bound to offer increasing scope for women to become involved in novel types of\nnoncombat military assignments.\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to\n","options":["present an overview of the different types of assignments available to women in the new United States\nall-volunteer armed forces\n","present a reasonedprognosis of the status of women in the new United States all-volunteer armed forces\n","present the new United States all-volunteer armed forces as a model case of equal employment policies\nin action\n","analyze reforms in the new United States all-volunteer armed forces necessitated by the increasing\nnumber of women in the military\n","analyze the use of functional equivalence as a substitute for occupational equality in the new United\nStates all-volunteer armed forces\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, despite the United States armed forces‘ commitment to occupational equality for\nwomen in the military, certain other factors preclude women‘s\n","options":["receiving equal pay for equal work\n","having access to positions of responsibility at most levels\n","drawing assignments from a wider range of assignments than before\n","benefiting from opportunities arising from new noncombat functions\n","being assigned all of the military tasks that are assigned to men\n"]},{"subject":" The passage implies that which of the following is a factor conducive to a more equitable representation of\nwomen in the United States armed forces than has existed in the past?\n","options":["The all-volunteer character of the present armed forces\n","The past service records of women who had assignments functionally equivalent to men‘s assignments\n","The level of awareness on the part of the larger society of military issues\n","A decline in the proportion of deterrence oriented noncombat assignments\n","Restrictive past policies governing the military assignments open to women\n"]},{"subject":" The ―dramatic gains for women‖ (in the highlighted portion) and the attitude, as described in the passage, of\na ―significant portion of the larger society‖ are logically related to each other inasmuch as the author puts\n\n\fforward the latter as\n","options":["a public response to achievement of the former\n","the major reason for absence of the former\n","a precondition for any prospect of achieving the former\n","a catalyst for a further extension of the former\n","a reason for some of the former being lost again\n\n\f"]}]}
