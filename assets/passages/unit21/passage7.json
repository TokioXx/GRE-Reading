{"title":"关于英国军队的作用的研究令人难以信服","passage":"91\n❶A long-held view of the history of the English colonies that became the United States has been that\nEngland’s policy toward these colonies before 1763 was dictated by commercial interests and that a\nchange to a more imperial policy, dominated by expansionist militarist objectives, generated the tensions\nthat ultimately led to the American Revolution. ❷In a recent study, Stephen Saunders Webb has presented a\nformidable challenge to this view. ❸According to Webb, England already had a military imperial policy for\nmore than a century before the American Revolution. ❹He sees Charles II, the English monarch between 1660\nand 1685, as the proper successor of the Tudor monarchs of the sixteenth century and of Oliver Cromwell, all of\nwhom were bent on extending centralized executive power over England‘s possessions through the use of what\nWebb calls ―garrison government.‖ ❺Garrison government allowed the colonists a legislative assembly, but\nreal authority, in Webb‘s view, belonged to the colonial governor, who was appointed by the king and supported\nby the ―garrison,‖ that is, by the local contingent of English troops under the colonial governor‘s command.\n❶According to Webb, the purpose of garrison government was to provide military support for a royal\npolicy designed to limit the power of the upper classes in the American colonies. ❷Webb argues that the\ncolonial legislative assemblies represented the interests not of the common people but of the colonial upper\nclasses, a coalition of merchants and nobility who favored self-rule and sought to elevate legislative authority\nat the expense of the executive. ❸It was, according to Webb, the colonial governors who favored the small\nfarmer, opposed the plantation system, and tried through taxation to break up large holdings of land. ❹Backed\nby the military presence of the garrison, these governors tried to prevent the gentry and merchants, allied in the\ncolonial assemblies, from transforming colonial America into a capitalistic oligarchy.\n❶Webb‘s study illuminates the political alignments that existed in the colonies in the century prior to the\nAmerican Revolution, but his view of the crown‘s use of the military as an instrument of colonial policy is not\nentirely convincing. ❷England during the seventeenth century was not noted for its military achievements.\n❸Cromwell did mount England‘s most ambitious overseas military expedition in more than a century, but it\nproved to be an utter failure. ❹Under Charles II, the English army was too small to be a major instrument of\ngovernment. ❺Not until the war with France in 1697 did William III persuade Parliament to create a\nprofessional standing army, and Parliaments price for doing so was to keep the army under tight legislative\ncontrol. ❻While it may be true that the crown attempted to curtail the power of the colonial upper classes,\nit is hard to imagine how the English army during the seventeenth century could have provided significant\nmilitary support for such a policy.\n\n\f21.
