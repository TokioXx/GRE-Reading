{"id":"ilvyr007004","title":"二月革命没有有效记录","content":["\n❶In February 1848 the people of Paris rose in revolt against the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe.\n❷Despite the existence of excellent narrative accounts, the February Days, as this revolt is called, have been\nlargely ignored by social historians of the past two decades. ❸For each of the three other major insurrections in\nnineteenth-century Paris—July 1830, June 1848, and May 1871—there exists at least a sketch of participants‘\nbackgrounds and an analysis, more or less rigorous, of the reasons for the occurrence of the uprisings. ❹Only in\nthe case of the February Revolution do we lack a useful description of participants that might characterize it in\nthe light of what social history has taught us about the process of revolutionary mobilization.","❶Two reasons for this relative neglect seem obvious. ❷First, the insurrection of February has been\novershadowed by that of June. ❸The February Revolution overthrew a regime, to be sure, but met with so little\nresistance that it failed to generate any real sense of historical drama. ❹Its successor, on the other hand,\nappeared to pit key socioeconomic groups in a life-or-death struggle and was widely seen by contemporary\nobservers as marking a historical departure. ❺Through their interpretations, which exert a continuing influence\non our understanding of the revolutionary process, the impact of the events of June has been magnified, while, as\nan unintended consequence, the significance of the February insurrection has been diminished. ❻Second, like\nother ―successful‖ insurrections, the events of February failed to generate the most desirable kinds of historical\nrecords. ❼Although the June insurrection of 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871 would be considered\nwatersheds of nineteenth-century French history by any standard, they also present the social historian with a\nsignal advantage: these failed insurrections created a mass of invaluable documentation as a by-product of\nauthorities‘ efforts to search out and punish the rebels.","❶Quite different is the outcome of successful insurrections like those of July 1830 and February 1848.\n❷Experiences are retold, but participants typically resume their daily routines without ever recording their\nactivities. ❸Those who played salient roles may become the objects of highly embellished verbal accounts or in\nrare cases, of celebratory articles in contemporary periodicals. ❹And it is true that the publicly acknowledged\nleaders of an uprising frequently write memoirs. ❺However, such documents are likely to be highly unreliable,\nunrepresentative, and unsystematically preserved, especially when compared to the detailed judicial dossiers\nprepared for everyone arrested following a failed insurrection. ❻As a consequence, it may prove difficult or\nimpossible to establish for a successful revolution a comprehensive and trustworthy picture of those who\nparticipated, or to answer even the most basic questions one might pose concerning the social origins of the\ninsurgents.","\f17.
