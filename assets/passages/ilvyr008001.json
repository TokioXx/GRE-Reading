{"id":"ilvyr008001","title":"黑人家庭的稳定和扩大的亲属关系对黑人文化传承的重要性","content":["\n❶In his 1976 study of slavery in the United States, Herbert Gutman, like Fogel, Engerman, and Genovese,\nhas rightly stressed the slaves’ achievements. ❷But unlike these historians, Gutman gives plantation owners\nlittle credit for these achievements. ❸Rather, Gutman argues that one must look to the Black family and the\nslaves‘ extended kinship system to understand how crucial achievements, such as the maintenance of a cultural\nheritage and the development of a communal consciousness, were possible. ❹His findings compel attention.","❶Gutman recreates the family and extended kinship structure mainly through an ingenious use of what any\nhistorian should draw upon, quantifiable data, derived in this case mostly from plantation birth registers. ❷He\nalso uses accounts of ex-slaves to probe the human reality behind his statistics. ❸These sources indicate that the\ntwo-parent household predominated in slave quarters just as it did among freed slaves after emancipation.\n❹Although Gutman admits that forced separation by sale was frequent, he shows that the slaves‘ preference,\nrevealed most clearly on plantations where sale was infrequent, was very much for stable monogamy. ❺In less\nconclusive fashion Fogel, Engerman, and Genovese had already indicated the predominance of two-parent\nhouseholds; however, only Gutman emphasizes the preference for stable monogamy and points out what stable\nmonogamy meant for the slaves‘ cultural heritage. ❻Gutman argues convincingly that the stability of the Black\nfamily encouraged the transmission of—and so was crucial in sustaining—the Black heritage of folklore, music,\nand religious expression from one generation to another, a heritage that slaves were continually fashioning out of\ntheir African and American experiences.","❶Gutman‘s examination of other facets of kinship also produces important findings. ❷Gutman discovers that\ncousins rarely married, an exogamous tendency that contrasted sharply with the endogamy practiced by the\nplantation owners. ❸This preference for exogamy, Gutman suggests, may have derived from West African\nrules governing marriage, which, though they differed from one tribal group to another, all involved some kind\nof prohibition against unions with close kin. ❹This taboo against cousins‘ marrying is important, argues\nGutman, because it is one of many indications of a strong awareness among slaves of an extended kinship\nnetwork. ❺The fact that distantly related kin would care for children separated from their families also suggests\nthis awareness. ❻When blood relationships were few, as in newly created plantations in the Southwest, ―fictive‖\nkinship arrangements took their place until a new pattern of consanguinity developed. ❼Gutman presents\nconvincing evidence that this extended kinship structure—which he believes developed by the mid-to-late\neighteenth century—provided the foundations for the strong communal consciousness that existed among slaves.","❶In sum, Gutman‘s study is significant because it offers a closely reasoned and original explanation of some of\nthe slaves‘ achievements, one that correctly emphasizes the resources that slaves themselves possessed.","\f20.
