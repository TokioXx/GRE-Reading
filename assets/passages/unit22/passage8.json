{"title":"器官移植通常有两个问题，而肝移植是个特例","passage":"02\n❶The transplantation of organs from one individual to another normally involves two major problems: (1)\norgan rejection is likely unless the transplantation antigens of both individuals are nearly identical, and (2) the\nintroduction of any unmatched transplantation antigens induces the development by the recipient of\ndonor-specific lymphocytes that will produce violent rejection of further transplantations from that donor.\n❷However, we have found that among many strains of rats these ―normal‖ rules of transplantation are not\nobeyed by liver transplants. ❸Not only are liver transplants never rejected, but they even induce a state of\ndonor-specific unresponsiveness in which subsequent transplants of other organs, such as skin, from that donor\nare accepted permanently. ❹Our hypothesis is that (1) many strains of rats simply cannot mount a sufficiently\nvigorous destructive immune-response(using lymphocytes) to outstrip the liver‘s relatively great capacity to\nprotect itself from immune-response damage and that (2) the systemic unresponsiveness observed is due to\nconcentration of the recipient‘s donor-specific lymphocytes at the site of the liver transplant\n\n","questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to treat the accepted generalizations about organ transplantation in\nwhich of the following ways?\n","options":["Explicate their main features\n","Suggest an alternative to them\n","Examine their virtues and limitations\n","Criticize the major evidence used to support them\n","Present findings that qualify them\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes that an important difference among strains of rats\nis the\n","options":["size of their livers\n","constitution of their skin\n","strength of their immune-response reactions\n","sensitivity of their antigens\n","adaptability of their lymphocytes\n"]},{"subject":" According to the hypothesis of the author, after a successful liver transplant, the reason that rats do not reject\nfurther transplants of other organs from the same donor is that the\n","options":["transplantation antigens of the donor and the recipient become matched\n","lymphocytes of the recipient are weakened by the activity of the transplanted liver\n","subsequently transplanted organ is able to repair the damage caused by the recipient‘s immune-response\nreaction\n","transplanted liver continues to be the primary locus for the recipient‘s immune-response reaction\n","recipient is unable to manufacture the lymphocytes necessary for the immune-response reaction\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following new findings about strains of rats that do not normally reject liver transplants, if true,\nwould support the authors‘ hypothesis?\nI.\n\nStomach transplants are accepted by the recipients in all cases.\n\nII.\n\nIncreasing the strength of the recipient‘s immune-response reaction can induce liver-transplant\n\n\frejection.\nIII.
