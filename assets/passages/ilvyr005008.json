{"id":"ilvyr005008","title":"摄影技术是矛盾的","content":["\n❶Picture-taking is a technique both for annexing the objective world and for expressing the singular self.\n❷Photographs depict objective realities that already exist, though only the camera can disclose them. ❸And\nthey depict an individual photographer‘s temperament, discovering itself through the camera‘s cropping of\nreality. ❹That is, photography has two antithetical ideals: in the first, photography is about the world and the\nphotographer is a mere observe who counts for little; but in the second, photography is the instrument of intrepid,\nquesting subjectivity and the photographer is all.","❶These conflicting ideals arise from a fundamental uneasiness on the part of both photographers and viewers of\nphotographs toward the aggressive component in ―taking‖ a picture. ❷Accordingly, the ideal of a photographer\nas observer is attractive because it implicitly denies that picture-taking is an aggressive act. ❸The issue, of\ncourse, is not so clear-cut. ❹What photographers do cannot be characterized as simply predatory or as simply,\nand essentially, benevolent. ❺As a consequence, one ideal of picture-taking or the other is always being\nrediscovered and championed.","❶An important result of the coexistence of these two ideals is a recurrent ambivalence toward photography‘s\nmeans. ❷Whatever the claims that photography might make to be a form of personal expression on a par with\npainting, its originality is inextricably linked to the powers of a machine. ❸The steady growth of these powers\nhas made possible the extraordinary informativeness and imaginative formal beauty of many photographs, like\nHarold Edgerton‘s high-speed photographs of a bullet hitting its target or of the swirls and eddies of a tennis\nstroke. ❹But as cameras become more sophisticated, more automated, some photographers are tempted to\ndisarm themselves or to suggest that they are not really armed, preferring to submit themselves to the limits\nimposed by premodern camera technology because a cruder, less high-powered machine is thought to give more\ninteresting or emotive results, to leave more room for creative accident. ❺For example, it has been virtually a\npoint of honor for many photographers, including Walker Evans and Cartier-Bresson, to refuse to use modern\nequipment. ❻These photographers have come to doubt the value of the camera as an instrument of ―fast seeing‖.\n❼Cartier-Bresson, in fact, claims that the modern camera may see too fast.","❶This ambivalence toward photographic means determines trends in taste. ❷The cult of the future (of faster\nand faster seeing) alternates over time with the wish to return to a purer past—when images had a handmade\nquality. ❸This nostalgia for some pristine state of the photographic enterprise is currently widespread and\nunderlies the present-day enthusiasm for daguerreotypes and the wok of forgotten nineteenth-century provincial\nphotographers. ❹Photographers and viewers of photographs, it seems, need periodically to resist their own\nknowingness.","\f21.
