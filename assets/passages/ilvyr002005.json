{"id":"ilvyr002005","title":"创造性艺术不创造新事物","content":["\n❶Extraordinary creative activity has been characterized as revolutionary, flying in the face of what is\nestablished and producing not what is acceptable but what will become accepted. ❷According to this\nformulation, highly creative activity transcends the limits of an existing form and establishes a new principle of\norganization. ❸However, the idea that extraordinary creativity transcends established limits is misleading when\nit is applied to the arts, even though it may be valid for the sciences. ❹Differences between highly creative art\nand highly creative science arise in part from a difference in their goals. ❺For the sciences, a new theory is the\ngoal and end result of the creative act. ❻Innovative science produces new propositions in terms of which\ndiverse phenomena can be related to one another in more coherent ways. ❼Such phenomena as a brilliant\ndiamond or a nesting bird are relegated to the role of data, serving as the means for formulating or testing a new\ntheory. ❽The goal of highly creative art is very different: the phenomenon itself becomes the direct product of\nthe creative act. ❾Shakespeare‘s Hamlet is not a tract about the behavior of indecisive princes or the uses of\npolitical power; nor is Picasso‘s painting Guernica primarily a propositional statement about the Spanish Civil\nWar or the evils of fascism. ❿What highly creative artistic activity produces is not a new generalization that\ntranscends established limits, but rather an aesthetic particular. 11Aesthetic\n○\nparticulars produced by the highly\ncreative artist extend or exploit, in an innovative way, the limits of an existing form, rather than transcend that\nform.","❶This is not to deny that a highly creative artist sometimes establishes a new principle of organization in the\nhistory of an artistic field; the composer Monteverdi, who created music of the highest aesthetic value, comes to\nmind. ❷More generally, however, whether or nota composition establishes a new principle in the history of\nmusic has little bearing on its aesthetic worth. ❸Because they embody a new principle of organization, some\nmusical works, such as the operas of the Florentine Camerata, are of signal historical importance, but few\nlisteners or musicologists would include these among the great works of music. ❹On the other hand, Mozart‘s\nThe Marriage of Figaro is surely among the masterpieces of music even though its modest innovations are\nconfined to extending existing means. ❺It has been said of Beethoven that he toppled the rules and freed music\nfrom the stifling confines of convention. ❻But a close study of his compositions reveals that Beethoven\noverturned no fundamental rules. ❼Rather, he was an incomparable strategist who exploited limits—the rules,\nforms, and conventions that he inherited from predecessors such as Haydn and Mozart, Handel and Bach—in\nstrikingly original ways.","\f21.
