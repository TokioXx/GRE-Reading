M. McClellen may be mentioned as exceptions. ❸They chose not to write in dialect,\nwhich, as Sterling Brown has suggested, “meant a rejection of stereotypes of Negro life,” and they refused\nto write only about racial subjects. ❹This refusal had both a positive and a negative consequence. ❺As\nBrown observes, ―Valuably insisting that Negro poets should not be confined to issues of race, these poets\ncommitted [an] error… they refused to look into their hearts and write.‖ ❻These are important insights, but one\nmust stress that this refusal to look within was also typical of most White poets of the United States at the time.\n❼They, too, often turned from their own experience and consequently produced not very memorable poems\nabout vague topics, such as the peace of nature.","\f17.
