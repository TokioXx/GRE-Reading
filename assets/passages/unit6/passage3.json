{"title":"非酶糖基化导致机体发生变化，可能是导致白内障的原因","passage":"9\n❶As people age, their cells become less efficient and less able to replace damaged components. ❷At the same\ntime their tissues stiffen. ❸For example, the lungs and the heart muscle expand less successfully, the blood\nvessels become increasingly rigid, and the ligaments and tendons tighten.\n❶Few investigators would attribute such diverse effects to a single cause. ❷Nevertheless, researchers have\ndiscovered that a process long known to discolor and toughen foods may also contribute to age-related\nimpairment of both cells and tissues. ❸That process is nonenzymatic glycosylation, whereby glucose becomes\nattached to proteins without the aid of enzymes. ❹When enzymes attach glucose to proteins (enzymatic\nglycosylation), they do so at a specific site on a specific protein molecule for a specific purpose. ❺In contrast,\nthe nonenzymatic process adds glucose haphazardly to any of several sites along any available peptide chain\nwithin a protein molecule.\n❶This nonenzymatic glycosylation of certain proteins has been understood by food chemists for decades,\nalthough few biologists recognized until recently that the same steps could take place in the body.\n❷Nonenzymatic glycosylation begins when an aldehyde group (CHO) of glucose and an amino group (NH2) of\na protein are attracted to each other. ❸The molecules combine, forming what is called a Schiff base within the\nprotein. ❹This combination is unstable and quickly rearranges itself into a stabler, but still reversible, substance\nknown as an Amadori product.\n❶If a given protein persists in the body for months or years, some of its Amadori products slowly dehydrate and\nrearrange themselves yet again, into new glucose-derived structures. ❷These can combine with various kinds of\nmolecules to form irreversible structures named advanced glycosylation end products (AGE‘s). ❸Most AGE‘s\nare yellowish brown and fluorescent and have specific spectrographic properties. ❹More important for the body,\nmany are also able to cross-link adjacent proteins, particularly ones that give structure to tissues and organs.\n❺Although no one has yet satisfactorily described the origin of all such bridges between proteins, many\ninvestigators agree that extensive cross-linking of proteins probably contributes to the stiffening and loss of\nelasticity characteristic of aging tissues.\n❶In an attempt to link this process with the development of cataracts (the browning and clouding of the lens of\nthe eye as people age), researchers studied the effect of glucose on solutions of purified crystallin, the major\nprotein in the lens of the eye. ❷Glucose-free solutions remained clear, but solutions with glucose caused the\nproteins to form clusters, suggesting that the molecules had become cross-linked. ❸The clusters diffracted light,\nmaking the solution opaque. ❹The researchers also discovered that the pigmented cross-links in human\ncataracts have the brownish color and fluorescence characteristic of AGE‘s. ❺These data suggest that\nnonenzymatic glycosylation of lens crystallins may contribute to cataract formation.\n\n\f17.
