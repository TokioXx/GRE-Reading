{"title":"理论数学过于精确会带来不好的结果","passage":"0\n(The passage below is drawn from an article published in 1962.)\n❶Computer programmers often remark that computing machines, with a perfect lack of discrimination, will do\nany foolish thing they are told to do. ❷The reason for this lies, of course, in the narrow fixation of the\ncomputing machine‘s ―intelligence‖ on the details of its own perceptions—its inability to be guided by any large\ncontext. ❸In a psychological description of the computer intelligence, three related adjectives come to mind:\nsingle-minded, literal-minded, and simpleminded. ❹Recognizing this, we should at the same time recognize\nthat this single-mindedness, literal-mindedness, and simplemindedness also characterizes theoretical\nmathematics, though to a lesser extent.\n\n❶Since science tries to deal with reality, even the most precise sciences normally work with more or less\nimperfectly understood approximations toward which scientists must maintain an appropriate skepticism.\n❷Thus, for instance, it may come as a shock to mathematicians to learn that the Schrodinger equation for the\nhydrogen atom is not a literally correct description of this atom, but only an approximation to a somewhat more\ncorrect equation taking account of spin, magnetic dipole, and relativistic effects; and that this corrected equation\nis itself only an imperfect approximation to an infinite set of quantum field-theoretical equations. ❸Physicists,\nlooking at the original Schrodinger equation, learn to sense in it the presence of many invisible terms in addition\nto the differential terms visible, and this sense inspires an entirely appropriate disregard for the purely technical\nfeatures of the equation. ❹This very healthy skepticism is foreign to the mathematical approach.\n\n❶Mathematics must deal with well-defined situations. ❷Thus, mathematicians depend on an intellectual effort\noutside of mathematics for the crucial specification of the approximation that mathematics is to take literally.\n❸Give mathematicians a situation that is the least bit ill-defined, and they will make it well-defined, perhaps\nappropriately, but perhaps inappropriately. ❹In some cases, the mathematicians‘ literal-mindedness may have\nunfortunate consequences. ❺The mathematicians turn the scientists‘ theoretical assumptions, that is, their\nconvenient points of analytical emphasis, into axioms, and then take these axioms literally. ❻This brings the\ndanger that they may also persuade the scientists to take these axioms literally. ❼The question, central to the\nscientific investigation but intensely disturbing in the mathematical context—what happens if the axioms are\nrelaxed?—is thereby ignored.\n\n❶The physicist rightly dreads precise argument, since an argument that is convincing only if it is precise loses\nall its force if the assumptions on which it is based are slightly changed, whereas an argument that is convincing\nthough imprecise may well be stable under small perturbations of its underlying assumptions.\n\n\f21.
