{"id":"ilvyr0020009","title":"星鲽比目鱼眼睛不对称性的差异不重要","content":["\n❶Flatfish, such as the flounder, are among the few vertebrates that lack approximate bilateral symmetry\n(symmetry in which structures to the left and right of the body‘s midline are mirror images). ❷Most striking\namong the many asymmetries evident in an adult flatfish is eye placement: before maturity one eye migrates, so\nthat in an adult flatfish both eyes are on the same side of the head. ❸While in most species with asymmetries\nvirtually all adults share the same asymmetry, members of the starry flounder species can be either left-eyed\n(both eyes on the left side of head) or right-eyed. ❹In the waters between the United States and Japan, the starry\nflounder populations vary from about 50 percent left-eyed off the United States West Coast, through about 70\npercent left-eyed halfway between the United States and Japan, to nearly 100 percent left-eyed off the Japanese\ncoast.\n❶Biologists call this kind of gradual variation over a certain geographic range a ―cline‖ and interpret clines\nas strong indications that the variation is adaptive, a response to environmental differences. ❷For the starry\nflounder this interpretation implies that a geometric difference (between fish that are mirror images of one\nanother) is adaptive, that left-eyedness in the Japanese starry flounder has been selected for, which provokes a\nperplexing questions: what is the selective advantage in having both eyes on one side rather than on the other?\n❶The ease with which a fish can reverse the effect of the sidedness of its eye asymmetry simply by turning\naround has caused biologists to study internal anatomy, especially the optic nerves, for the answer. ❷In all\nflatfish the optic nerves cross, so that the right optic nerve is joined to the brain‘s left side and vice versa. ❸This\ncrossing introduces an asymmetry, as one optic nerve must cross above or below the other. ❹G. H. Parker\nreasoned that if, for example, a flatfish‘s left eye migrated when the right optic nerve was on top, there would be\na twisting of nerves, which might be mechanically disadvantageous. ❺For starry flounders, then, the left-eyed\nvariety would be selected against, since in a starry flounder the left optic nerve is uppermost.\n❶The problem with the above explanation is that the Japanese starry flounder population is almost\nexclusively left-eyed, a natural selection never promotes a purely less advantageous variation. ❷As other\nexplanations proved equally untenable, biologists concluded that there is no important adaptive difference\nbetween left-eyedness and right-eyedness, and that the two characteristics are genetically associated with some\nother adaptively significant characteristic. ❸This situation is one commonly encountered by evolutionary\nbiologists, who must often decide whether a characteristic is adaptive or selectively neutral. ❹As for the\nleft-eyed and right-eyed flatfish, their difference, however striking, appears to be an evolutionary red herring.","\f21.
