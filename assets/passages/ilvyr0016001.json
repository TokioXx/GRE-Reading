{"id":"ilvyr0016001","title":"死后成为超新星的星球数量少于人们的推测的原因","content":["\n❶Until recently astronomers have been puzzled by the fate of red giant and supergiant stars. ❷When the core\nof a giant star whose mass surpasses 1.4 times the present mass of our Sun (M⊙) exhausts its nuclear fuel, it is\nunable to support its own weight and collapses into a tiny neutron star. ❸The gravitational energy released\nduring this implosion of the core blows off the remainder of the star in a gigantic explosion, or a supernova.\n❹Since around 50 percent of all stars are believed to begin their lives with masses greater than 1.4M⊙, we\nmight expect that one out of every two stars would die as a supernova. ❺But in fact, only one star in thirty dies\nsuch a violent death. ❻The rest expire much more peacefully as planetary nebulas. ❼Apparently most\nmassive stars manage to lose sufficient material that their masses drop below the critical value of 1.4 M⊙\nbefore they exhaust their nuclear fuel.","❶Evidence supporting this view comes from observations of IRC+10216, a pulsating giant star located 700\nlight-years away from Earth. ❷A huge rate of mass loss (1 M⊙ every 10,000 years) has been deduced from\ninfrared observations of ammonia (NH3) molecules located in the circumstellar cloud around IRC+10216.\n❸Recent microwave observations of carbon monoxide (CO) molecules indicate a similar rate of mass loss and\ndemonstrate that the escaping material extends outward from the star for a distance of at least one light-year.\n❹Because we know the size of the cloud around IRC+10216 and can use our observations of either NH3 or CO\nto measure the outflow velocity, we can calculate an age for the circumstellar cloud. ❺IRC+10216 has\napparently expelled, in the form of molecules and dust grains, a mass equal to that of our entire Sun within the\npast ten thousand years. ❻This implies that some stars can shed huge amounts of matter very quickly and thus\nmay never expire as supernovas. ❼Theoretical models as well as statistics on supernovas and planetary nebulas\nsuggest that stars that begin their lives with masses around 6 M⊙ shed sufficient material to drop below the\ncritical value of 1.4 M⊙. ❽IRC+10216, for example, should do this in a mere 50,000 years from its birth, only\nan instant in the life of a star.","❶But what place does IRC+10216 have in stellar evolution? ❷Astronomers suggest that stars like IRC+10216\nare actually ―protoplanetary nebulas‖—old giant stars whose dense cores have almost but not quite rid\nthemselves of the fluffy envelopes of gas around them. ❸Once the star has lost the entire envelope, its exposed\ncore becomes the central star of the planetary nebula and heats and ionizes the last vestiges of the envelope as it\nflows away into space. ❹This configuration is a full-fledged planetary nebula, long familiar to optical\nastronomers.","\f21.
