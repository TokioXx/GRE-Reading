{"title":"在工程设计中，应该加入设计课程","passage":"9\n❶Many objects in daily use have clearly been influenced by science, but their form and function, their\ndimensions and appearance, were determined by technologists, artisans, designers, inventors, and\nengineers—using non-scientific modes of thought. ❷Many features and qualities of the objects that a\ntechnologist thinks about cannot be reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in the mind\nby a visual, nonverbal process. ❸In the development of Western technology, it has been non-verbal thinking, by\nand large, that has fixed the outlines and filled in the details of our material surroundings. ❹Pyramids,\ncathedrals, and rockets exist not because of geometry or thermodynamics, but because they were first a picture in\nthe minds of those who built them.\n❶The creative shaping process of a technologist‘s mind can be seen in nearly every artifact that exists. ❷For\nexample, in designing a diesel engine, a technologist might impress individual ways of nonverbal thinking on the\nmachine by continually using an intuitive sense of rightness and fitness. ❸What would be the shape of the\ncombustion chamber? ❹Where should the valves be placed? ❺Should it have a long or short piston? ❻Such\nquestions have a range of answers that are supplied by experience, by physical requirements, by limitations of\navailable space, and not least by a sense of form. ❼Some decisions, such as wall thickness and pin diameter,\nmay depend on scientific calculations, but the nonscientific component of design remains primary.\n❶Design courses, then, should be an essential element in engineering curricula. ❷Nonverbal thinking, a\ncentral mechanism in engineering design, involves perceptions, the stock-in-trade of the artist, not the scientist.\n❸Because perceptive processes are not assumed to entail ―hard thinking,‖ nonverbal thought is sometimes seen\nas a primitive stage in the development of cognitive processes and inferior to verbal or mathematical thought.\n❹But it is paradoxical that when the staff of the Historic American Engineering Record wished to have\ndrawings made of machines and isometric views of industrial processes for its historical record of American\nengineering, the only college students with the requisite abilities were not engineering students, but rather\nstudents attending architectural schools.\n❶If courses in design, which in a strongly analytical engineering curriculum provide the background required\nfor practical problem-solving, are not provided, we can expect to encounter silly but costly errors occurring in\nadvanced engineering systems. ❷For example, early models of high-speed railroad cars loaded with\nsophisticated controls were unable to operate in a snowstorm because a fan sucked snow into the electrical\nsystem. ❸Absurd random failures that plague automatic control systems are not merely trivial aberrations;\nthey are a reflection of the chaos that results when design is assumed to be primarily a problem in mathematics.\n\n\f21.
