{"title":"胰腺移植用于治疗糖尿病还很困难","passage":"4\n(This passage was written in 1975.)\n❶The complications frequently accompanying diabetes, such as impairment of vision and of kidney function,\nare now thought to result from the lack of continuous control of blood glucose concentrations. ❷The healthy\npancreas, in response to increases in blood glucose concentration, releases small quantities of insulin throughout\nthe day and thereby maintains the concentration within physiological limits (normoglycemia). ❸But the\ndiabetic generally receives only one large dose daily. ❹The diabetic‘s blood glucose concentration can thus\nfluctuate greatly during the interval between doses, and it has been suggested that the complications result from\nthe periods of high concentrations of blood glucose (hyperglycemia). ❺Many investigators thus believe that\nrestoration of normoglycemia might halt the progression of such complications and perhaps even reverse them.\n❶There are three primary techniques that have been investigated for restoration of normoglycemia. ❷They are:\ntransplantation of whole, healthy pancreases; transplantation of islets of Langerhans, that portion of the pancreas\nthat actually secretes insulin; and implantation of artificial pancreases. ❸There has, in fact, been a great deal of\nsuccess in the development of these techniques and each seems, on the whole, promising. ❹Nonetheless, it will\nundoubtedly be many years before any one of them is accepted as a treatment for diabetes.\n❶To many people, the obvious approach would seem to be simply to transplant pancreases from cadavers in the\nsame manner that kidneys and other organs are routinely transplanted. ❷That was the rationale in 1966 when\nthe first recorded pancreas transplant was performed. ❸Between 1966 and 1975, there were forty-six pancreas\ntransplants in forty-five other patients in the United States and five other countries. ❹But only one of these\npatients is still alive with a functioning graft, and surgeons have found that the procedure is not as simple as they\nonce thought.\n❶The surviving patient has required no insulin since the operation. ❷Another patient survived 638 days\nwithout requiring insulin. ❸And one patient survived a transplantation for more than a year, but died when he\nchose not to take the immunosuppressive drugs. ❹These results, though meager, suggest that the procedure has\nthe potential for success.\n❶The rest of the patients, however, either rejected the transplant or died within a short period. ❷There does\nnot appear to be any technical problem with the procedure. ❸Rather, most of the patients were already so\nseverely debilitated by the complications of diabetes that they could not withstand the surgery and the\nimmunosuppressive regimen required to prevent rejection. ❹More than half of the patients, furthermore, also\nrequired a kidney transplant. ❺Most investigators now agree that the simultaneous transplantation of both\norgans is too great a shock to the patient and greatly increases the total risk.\n\n\f21. Which of the following best states one of the main conclusions of the passage?\n(A) Although the techniques for pancreas transplants appear to be theoretically correct, there are problems\nthat must be solved before the operation can be used as a treatment for diabetes.\n(B) Although the techniques for pancreas transplants are still being developed, the experimental results\nshow that the operation will be a successful treatment for diabetes in the near future.\n(C) Although pancreas transplants are reliable, many diabetics are reluctant to undergo the operation\nbecause of the side effects of immunosuppressive drugs.\n(D) Although pancreas transplants alone are not generally successful, the operation can be used in\nconjunction with other procedures to treat diabetes.\n(E) Although pancreas transplants have not been successful in treating diabetes, research indicates that other\nprocedures may soon be developed.\n","questions":[{"subject":" According to the passage, widely spaced doses of insulin can cause.\n","options":["reversal of normal kidney function\n","delay in the onset of diabetes\n","radical changes in the concentration of blood glucose\n","restoration of normoglycemia\n","marked variations in the islets of Langerhans\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, a periodic high concentration of blood glucose in diabetics is a possible cause of\n","options":["deterioration of the pancreas\n","damage to the eyes and kidneys\n","rejection of transplanted organs\n","inadequate secretion of insulin\n","increased production of blood cells\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that one of the important contributing causes of the failure of most\npancreas transplants has been the\n","options":["reluctance of patients to cooperate with physicians\n","imperfect techniques used in the operations\n","scarcity of immunosuppressive drugs\n","unavailability or healthy pancreases\n","weakened condition of the patients\n"]},{"subject":" The author provides information that would answer which of the following questions?\nI.\n\nWhat is hyperglycemia?\n\nII.\n\nWhat is one cause of hyperglycemia?\n\nIII.
