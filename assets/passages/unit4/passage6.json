{"title":"针对黑人的歧视出现在奴隶制之前","passage":"1\n❶The first mention of slavery in the statutes of the English colonies of North America does not occur\nuntil after 1660—some forty years after the importation of the first Black people. ❷Lest we think that\nslavery existed in fact before it did in law, Oscar and Mary Handlin assure us that the status of Black\npeople down to the 1660’s was that of servants. ❸A critique of the Handlins‘ interpretation of why legal\nslavery did not appear until the 1660‘s suggests that assumptions about the relation between slavery and racial\nprejudice should be reexamined, and that explanations for the different treatment of Black slaves in North and\nSouth America should be expanded.\n\n❶The Handlins explain the appearance of legal slavery by arguing that, during the 1660‘s, the position of White\nservants was improving relative to that of Black servants. ❷Thus, the Handlins contend, Black and White\nservants, heretofore treated alike, each attained a different status. ❸There are, however, important objections to\nthis argument. ❹First, the Handlins cannot adequately demonstrate that the White servant‘s position was\nimproving during and after the 1660‘s; several acts of the Maryland and Virginia legislatures indicate\notherwise. ❺Another flaw in the Handlins‘ interpretation is their assumption that prior to the establishment of\nlegal slavery there was no discrimination against Black people. ❻It is true that before the 1660‘s Black people\nwere rarely called slaves. ❼But this should not overshadow evidence from the 1630‘s on that points to racial\ndiscrimination without using the term slavery. ❽Such discrimination sometimes stopped short of lifetime\nservitude or inherited status—the two attributes of true slavery—yet in other cases it included both. ❾The\nHandlins‘ argument excludes the real possibility that Black people in the English colonies were never treated as\nthe equals of White people.\n\n❶This possibility has important ramifications. ❷If from the outset Black people were discriminated against,\nthen legal slavery should be viewed as a reflection and an extension of racial prejudice rather than, as many\nhistorians including the Handlins have argued, the cause of prejudice. ❸In addition, the existence of\ndiscrimination before the advent of legal slavery offers a further explanation for the harsher treatment of Black\nslaves in North than in South America. ❹Freyre and Tannenbaum have rightly argued that the lack of certain\ntraditions in North America—such as a Roman conception of slavery and a Roman Catholic emphasis on\nequality—explains why the treatment of Black slaves was more severe there than in the Spanish and Portuguese\ncolonies of South America. ❺But this cannot be the whole explanation since it is merely negative, based only\non a lack of something. ❻A more compelling explanation is that the early and sometimes extreme racial\ndiscrimination in the English colonies helped determine the particular nature of the slavery that followed.\n\n\f21.
