{"id":"ilvyr0012008","title":"介绍热点","content":["\n❶ ―I want to criticize the social system, and to show it at work, at its most intense.‖ ❷Virginia Woolf‘s\nprovocative statement about her intentions in writing Mrs. Dalloway has regularly been ignored by the critics,\nsince it highlights an aspect of her literary interests very different from the traditional picture of the ―poetic‖\nnovelist concerned with examining states of reverie and vision and with following the intricate pathways of\nindividual consciousness. ❸But Virginia Woolf was a realistic as well as a poetic novelist, a satirist and social\ncritic as well as a visionary: literary critics‘ cavalier dismissal of Woolf‘s social vision will not withstand\nscrutiny.","❶In her novels, Woolf is deeply engaged by the questions of how individuals are shaped (or deformed) by their\nsocial environments, how historical forces impinge on people‘s lives, how class, wealth, and gender help to\ndetermine people‘s fates. ❷Most of her novels are rooted in a realistically rendered social setting and in a\nprecise historical time.","❶Woolf‘s focus on society has not been generally recognized because of her intense antipathy to propaganda in\nart. ❷The pictures of reformers in her novels are usually satiric or sharply critical. ❸Even when Woolf is\nfundamentally sympathetic to their causes, she portrays people anxious to reform their society and possessed of a\nmessage or program as arrogant or dishonest, unaware of how their political ideas serve their own psychological\nneeds. ❹ (Her Writer’s Diary notes: ―the only honest people are the artists,‖ whereas ―these social reformers\nand philanthropists…harbor…discreditable desires under the disguise of loving their kind…‖) ❺Woolf detested\nwhat she called ―preaching‖ in fiction, too, and criticized novelist D. H. Lawrence (among others) for working\nby this method.","❶Woolf‘s own social criticism is expressed in the language of observation rather than in direct commentary,\nsince for her, fiction is a contemplative, not an active art. ❷She describes phenomena and provides materials for\na judgment about society and social issues; it is the reader‘s work to put the observations together and\nunderstand the coherent point of view behind them. ❸As a moralist, Woolf works by indirection, subtly\nundermining officially accepted mores, mocking, suggesting, calling into question, rather than asserting,\nadvocating, bearing witness: hers is the satirist‘s art.","❶Woolf‘s literary models were acute social observers like Chekhov and Chaucer. ❷As she put it in The\nCommon Reader, ―It is safe to say that not a single law has been framed or one stone set upon another because of\nanything Chaucer said or wrote; and yet, as we read him, we are absorbing morality at every pore.‖ ❸Like\nChaucer, Woolf chose to understand as well as to judge, to know her society root and branch—a decision crucial\nin order to produce art rather than polemic.","\f17.
