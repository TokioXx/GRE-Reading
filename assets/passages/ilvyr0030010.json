{"id":"ilvyr0030010","title":"评价Black Fiction","content":["\n❶Roger Rosenblatt‘s book Black Fiction, in attempting to apply literary rather than sociopolitical criteria to its\nsubject, successfully alters the approach taken by most previous studies. ❷As Rosenblatt notes, criticism of\nBlack writing has often served as a pretext for expounding on Black history. ❸Addison Gayle‘s recent work, for\nexample, judges the value of Black fiction by overtly political standards, rating each work according to the\nnotions of Black identity which it propounds.\n❶Although fiction assuredly springs from political circumstances, its authors react to those circumstances in\nways other than ideological, and talking about novels and stories primarily as instruments of ideology\ncircumvents much of the fictional enterprise. ❷Rosenblatt‘s literary analysis discloses affinities and connections\namong works of Black fiction which solely political studies have overlooked or ignored.\n❶Writing acceptable criticism of Black fiction, however, presupposes giving satisfactory answers to a number\nof questions. ❷First of all, is there a sufficient reason, other than the racial identity of the authors, to group\ntogether works by Black authors? ❸Second, how does Black fiction make itself distinct from other modern\nfiction with which it is largely contemporaneous? ❹Rosenblatt shows that Black fiction constitutes a distinct\nbody of writing that has an identifiable, coherent literary tradition. ❺Looking at novels written by Blacks over\nthe last eighty years, he discovers recurring concerns and designs independent of chronology. ❻These structures\nare thematic, and they spring, not surprisingly, from the central fact that the Black characters in these novels\nexist in a predominantly White culture, whether they try to conform to that culture or rebel against it.\n❶Black Fiction does leave some aesthetic questions open. ❷Rosenblatt‘s thematic analysis permits\nconsiderable objectivity; he even explicitly states that it is not his intention to judge the merit of the various\nworks—yet his reluctance seems misplaced, especially since an attempt to appraise might have led to interesting\nresults. ❸For instance, some of the novels appear to be structurally diffuse. ❹Is this a defect, or are the authors\nworking out of, or trying to forge, a different kind of aesthetic? ❺In addition, the style of some Black novels,\nlike Jean Toomer‘s Cane, verges on expressionism or surrealism; does this technique provide a counterpoint to\nthe prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black heroes are pitted, a theme usually conveyed by\nmore naturalistic modes of expression?\n❶In spite of such omissions, what Rosenblatt does include in his discussion makes for an astute and worthwhile\nstudy. ❷Black Fiction surveys a wide variety of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some\nfascinating and little-known works like James Weldon Johnson‘s Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. ❸Its\nargument is tightly constructed, and its forthright, lucid style exemplifies levelheaded and penetrating criticism.","\f21.
