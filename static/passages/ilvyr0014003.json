{"id":"ilvyr0014003","title":"实验并没有说明蛋白质合成与学习行为有关","content":["\n❶Few areas of neurobehavioral research seemed more promising in the early sixties than that investigating the\nrelationship between protein synthesis and learning. ❷The conceptual framework for this research was derived\ndirectly from molecular biology, which had shown that genetic information is stored in nucleic acids and\nexpressed in proteins. ❸Why not acquired information as well?","❶The first step toward establishing a connection between protein synthesis and learning seemed to be block\nmemory (cause amnesia) by interrupting the production of protein. ❷We were fortunate in finding a nonlethal\ndosage of puromycin that could, it first appeared, thoroughly inhibit brain protein synthesis as well as reliably\nproduce amnesia.","❶Before the actual connection between protein synthesis and learning could be established, however, we began\nto have doubts about whether inhibition of protein synthesis was in fact the method by which puromycin\nproduced amnesia. ❷First, other drugs, glutarimides—themselves potent protein-synthesis inhibitors—either\nfailed to cause amnesia in some situations where it could easily be induced by puromycin or produced an\namnesia with a different time course from that of puromycin. ❸Second, puromycin was found to inhibit protein\nsynthesis by breaking certain amino-acid chains, and the resulting fragments were suspected of being the actual\ncause of amnesia in some cases. ❹Third, puromycin was reported to cause abnormalities in the brain, including\nseizures. ❺Thus, not only were decreased protein synthesis and amnesia dissociated, but alternative\nmechanisms for the amnestic action of puromycin were readily suggested.","❶So, puromycin turned out to be a disappointment. ❷It came to be regarded as a poor agent for amnesia\nstudies, although, of course, it was poor only in the context of our original paradigm of protein-synthesis\ninhibition. ❸In our frustration, our initial response was simply to change drugs rather than our conceptual\norientation. ❹After many such disappointments, however, it now appears unlikely that we will make a firm\nconnection between protein synthesis and learning merely by pursuing the approaches of the past. ❺Our\nexperience with drugs has shown that all the amnestic agents often interfere with memory in ways that seem\nunrelated to their inhibition of protein synthesis. ❻More importantly, the notion that the interruption or\nintensification of protein production in the brain can be related in cause-and-effect fashion to learning now\nseems simplistic and unproductive. ❼Remove the battery from a car and the car will not go. ❽Drive the\ncar a long distance at high speed and the battery will become more highly charged. ❾Neither of these\nfacts proves that the battery powers the car; only a knowledge of the overall automotive system will reveal\nits mechanism of the locomotion and the role of the battery within that system.","\f21.
