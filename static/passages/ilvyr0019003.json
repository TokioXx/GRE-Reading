V. O. Quine, however, this constitutes an overly “narrow” conception of empiricism. ❷ ―All balls\nare red,‖ he maintains, forms one strand within an entire web of statements (our knowledge); individual\nobservations can be referred only to this web as a whole. ❸As new observations are collected, he explains, they\nmust be integrated into the web. ❹Problems occur only if a contradiction develops between a new observation,\nsay, ―That ball is blue,‖ and the preexisting statements. ❺In that case, he argues, any statement or combination\nof statements (not merely the ―offending‖ generalization, as in classical empiricism) can be altered to achieve the\nfundamental requirement, a system free of contradictions, even if, in some cases, the alteration consists of\nlabeling the new observation a ―hallucination.‖\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" The author of the passage is primarily concerned with presenting\n","options":["criticisms of Quine‘s views on the proper conceptualization of empiricism\n","evidence to support Quine‘s claims about the problems inherent in classical empiricism\n","an account of Quine‘s counterproposal to one of the traditional assumptions of classical empiricism\n","an overview of classical empiricism and its contributions to Quine‘s alternate understanding of\nempiricism\n","a history of classical empiricism and Quine‘s reservations about it\n"]},{"subject":" According to Quine‘s conception of empiricism, if a new observation were to contradict some statement\nalready within our system of knowledge, which of the following would be true?\n","options":["The new observation would be rejected as untrue.\n","Both the observation and the statement in our system that it contradicted would be discarded.\n","New observations would be added to our web of statements in order to expand our system of\nknowledge.\n","The observation or some part of our web of statements would need to be adjusted to resolve the\ncontradiction.\n","An entirely new field of knowledge would be created.\n"]},{"subject":" As described in the passage, Quine‘s specific argument against classical empiricism would be most\nstrengthened if he did which of the following?\n","options":["Provided evidence that many observations are actually hallucinations.\n","Explained why new observations often invalidate preexisting generalizations.\n","Challenged the mechanism by which specific generalizations are derived from collections of particular\nobservations.\n","Mentioned other critics of classical empiricism and the substance of their approaches.\n","Gave an example of a specific generalization that has not been invalidated despite a contrary\nobservation.\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that Quine considers classical empiricism to be ―overly ‗narrow‘ ‖ (in the\n\n\fhighlighted portion) for which of the following reasons?\nI.\n\n","options":["lassical empiricism requires that our system of generalizations be free of contradictions.\n\nII.\n\n","lassical empiricism demands that in the case of a contradiction between an individual observation\nand a generalization, the generalization must be abandoned.\n\nIII.
