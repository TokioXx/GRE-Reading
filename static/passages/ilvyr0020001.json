{"id":"ilvyr0020001","title":"摄影是艺术","content":["\n❶The earliest controversies about the relationship between photography and art centered on whether\nphotography‘s fidelity to appearances and dependence on a machine allowed it to be a fine art as distinct from\nmerely a practical art. ❷Throughout the nineteenth century, the defense of photography was identical with the\nstruggle to establish it as a fine art. ❸Against the charge that photography was a soulless, mechanical copying\nof reality, photographers asserted that it was instead a privileged way of seeing, a revolt against commonplace\nvision, and no less worthy an art than painting.","❶Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious\nor irrelevant to label it as such. ❷Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially\nobserving, witnessing events, exploring themselves—anything but making works of art. ❸In the nineteenth\ncentury, photography‘s association with the real world placed it in an ambivalent relation to art; late in the\ntwentieth century, an ambivalent relation exists because of the Modernist heritage in art. ❹That important\nphotographers are no longer willing to debate whether photography is or is not a fine art, except to proclaim that\ntheir own work is not involved with art, shows the extent to which they simply take for granted the concept of\nart imposed by the triumph of Modernism: the better the art, the more subversive it is of the traditional aims\nof art.\n❶Photographers‘ disclaimers of any interest in making art tell us more about the harried status of the\ncontemporary notion of art than about whether photography is or is not art. ❷For example, those photographers\nwho suppose that, by taking pictures, they are getting away from the pretensions of art as exemplified by\npainting remind us of those Abstract Expressionist painters who imagined they were getting away from the\nintellectual austerity of classical Modernist painting by concentrating on the physical act of painting. ❸Much of\nphotography‘s prestige today derives from the convergence of its aims with those of recent art, particularly with\nthe dismissal of abstract art implicit in the phenomenon of Pop painting during the 1960‘s. ❹Appreciating\nphotographs is a relief to sensibilities tired of the mental exertions demanded by abstract art. ❺Classical\nModernist painting—that is, abstract art as developed in different ways by Picasso, Kandinsky, and\nMatisse—presupposes highly developed skills of looking and a familiarity with other paintings and the history of\nart. ❻Photography, like Pop painting, reassures viewers that art is not hard; photography seems to be more\nabout its subjects than about art.","❶Photography, however, has developed all the anxieties and self-consciousness of a classic Modernist art.\n❷Many professionals privately have begun to worry that the promotion of photography as an activity\nsubversive of the traditional pretensions of art has gone so far that the public will forget that photography is a\ndistinctive and exalted activity—in short, an art.","\f21.
