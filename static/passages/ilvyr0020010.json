Sandford that Black people in the United States could be denied\ncitizenship. ❹The act was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson, who argued that the Thirteenth Amendment,\nwhich abolished slavery, did not provide Congress with the authority to extend citizenship and equal protection\nto the freed slaves. ❺Although Congress promptly overrode Johnson‘s veto, supporters of the act sought to\nensure its constitutional foundations with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.","❶The broad language of the amendment strongly suggests that its framers were proposing to write into the\nConstitution not a laundry list of specific civil rights but a principle of equal citizenship that forbids organized\nsociety from treating any individual as a member of an inferior class. ❷Yet for the first eight decades of the\namendment‘s existence, the Supreme Court‘s interpretation of the amendment betrayed this ideal of equality.\n❸In the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, for example, the Court invented the ―state action‖ limitation, which asserts\nthat ―private‖ decisions by owners of public accommodations and other commercial businesses to segregate their\nfacilities are insulated from the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment‘s guarantee of equal protection under the\nlaw.","❶After the Second World War, a judicial climate more hospitable to equal protection claims culminated in the\nSupreme Court‘s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that racially segregated schools violated the equal\nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ❷Two doctrines embraced by the Supreme Court during this\nperiod extended the amendment‘s reach. ❸First, the Court required especially strict scrutiny of legislation that\nemployed a ―suspect classification,‖ meaning discrimination against a group on grounds that could be construed\nas racial. ❹This doctrine has broadened the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to other, nonracial forms\nof discrimination, for while some justices have refused to find any legislative classification other than race to be\nconstitutionally disfavored, most have been receptive to arguments that at least some nonracial discriminations,\nsexual discrimination in particular, are ―suspect‖ and deserve this heightened scrutiny by the courts. ❺Second,\nthe Court relaxed the state action limitation on the Fourteenth Amendment, bringing new forms of\nprivate conduct within the amendment’s reach.","\f17. Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?\n(A) By presenting a list of specific rights, framers of the Fourteenth Amendment were attempting to provide\na constitutional basis for broad judicial protection of the principle of equal citizenship.\n(B) Only after the Supreme Court adopted the suspect classification approach to reviewing potentially\ndiscriminatory legislation was the applicability of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to include\nsexual discrimination.\n(C) Not until after the Second World War did the Supreme Court begin to interpret the Fourteenth\nAmendment in a manner consistent with the principle of equal citizenship that it expresses.\n(D) Interpreters of the Fourteenth Amendment have yet to reach consensus with regard to what its framers\nmeant by the equal protection clause.\n(E) Although the reluctance of judges to extend the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment to nonracial\ndiscrimination has betrayed the principle of equal citizenship, the Supreme Court‘s use of the state\naction limitation to insulate private activity from the amendment‘s reach has been more harmful.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" The passage suggests that the principal effect of the state action limitation was to\n","options":["allow some discriminatory practices to continue unimpeded by the Fourteenth Amendment\n","influence the Supreme Court‘s ruling in Brown v, Board of Education\n","provide expanded guidelines describing prohibited actions\n","prohibit states from enacting laws that violated the intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1866\n","shift to state governments the responsibility for enforcement of laws prohibiting discriminatory\npractices\n"]},{"subject":" The author‘s position regarding the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment would be most\nseriously undermined if which of the following were true?\n","options":["The framers had anticipated state action limitations as they are described in the passage.\n","The framers had merely sought to prevent discriminatory acts by federal officials.\n","The framers were concerned that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 would be overturned by the Supreme\n","ourt.\n","The framers were aware that the phrase ―equal protection of the laws‖ had broad implications.\n","The framers believed that racial as well as non-racial forms of discrimination were unacceptable.\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, the original proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment were primarily concerned\nwith\n","options":["detailing the rights afforded by the principle of equal citizenship\n","providing support in the Constitution for equal protection for all citizens of the United States\n","closing a loophole that could be used to deny individuals the right to sue for enforcement of their civil\nrights\n","asserting that the civil rights protected by the Constitution included nonracial discrimination as well as\nracial discrimination\n","granting state governments broader discretion in interpreting the Civil Rights Act of 1866\n"]},{"subject":" The author implies that the Fourteenth Amendment might not have been enacted if\n","options":["Congress‘ authority with regard to legislating civil rights had not been challenged\n\n\f(B) the framers had anticipated the Supreme Court‘s ruling in Brown v.
