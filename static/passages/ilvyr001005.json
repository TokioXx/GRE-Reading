{"id":"ilvyr001005","title":"对流更有可能是热液口生物的食物源","content":["\n(This passage is excerpted from an article that was published in 1981.)\n❶The deep sea typically has a sparse fauna dominated by tiny worms and crustaceans, with an even sparser\ndistribution of larger animals. ❷However, near hydrothermal vents, areas of the ocean where warm water\nemerges from subterranean sources, live remarkable densities of huge clams, blind crabs, and fish.","❶Most deep-sea faunas rely for food on particulate matter (particulate matter: 颗粒物质), ultimately derived\nfrom photosynthesis, falling from above. ❷The food supplies necessary to sustain the large vent communities,\nhowever, must be many times the ordinary fallout. ❸The first reports describing vent faunas proposed two\npossible sources of nutrition: bacterial chemosynthesis, production of food by bacteria using energy derived from\nchemical changes, and advection, the drifting of food materials from surrounding regions. ❹Later, evidence in\nsupport of the idea of intense local chemosynthesis was accumulated: hydrogen sulfide was found in vent water;\nmany vent-site bacteria were found to be capable of chemosynthesis; and extremely large concentrations of\nbacteria were found in samples of vent water thought to be pure. ❺This final observation seemed decisive. ❻If\nsuch astonishing concentrations of bacteria were typical of vent outflow, then food within the vent would dwarf\nany contribution from advection. ❼Hence, the widely quoted conclusion was reached that bacterial\nchemosynthesis provides the foundation for hydrothermal-vent food chains—an exciting prospect because no\nother communities on Earth are independent of photosynthesis.","❶There are, however, certain difficulties with this interpretation. ❷For example, some of the large sedentary\norganisms associated with vents are also found at ordinary deep-sea temperatures many meters from the nearest\nhydrothermal sources. ❸This suggests that bacterial chemosynthesis is not a sufficient source of nutrition for\nthese creatures. ❹Another difficulty is that similarly dense populations of large deep-sea animals have been\nfound in the proximity of ―smokers‖—vents where water emerges at temperatures up to 350℃. ❺No bacteria\ncan survive such heat, and no bacteria were found there. ❻Unless smokers are consistently located near more\nhospitable warm-water vents, chemosynthesis can account for only a fraction of the vent faunas. ❼It is\nconceivable, however, that these large, sedentary organisms do in fact feed on bacteria that grow in warm-water\nvents, rise in the vent water, and then rain in peripheral areas to nourish animals living some distance from the\nwarm-water vents.","❶Nonetheless advection is a more likely alternative food source. ❷Research has demonstrated that advective\nflow, which originates near the surface of the ocean where suspended particulate matter accumulates, transports\nsome of that matter and water to the vents. ❸Estimates suggest that for every cubic meter of vent discharge, 350\nmilligrams of particulate organic material would be advected into the vent area. ❹Thus, for an average-sized\nvent, advection could provide more than 30 kilograms of potential food per day. ❺In addition, it is likely that\nsmall live animals in the advected water might be killed or stunned by thermal and/or chemical shock, thereby\ncontributing to the food supply of vents.","\f16.
