{"id":"ilvyr0020004","title":"Walzer认为自由资本主义不够平等","content":["\n❶One of the principal themes of Walzer‘s critique of liberal capitalism is that it is insufficiently\negalitarian. ❷Walzer‘s case against the economic inequality generated by capitalism and in favor of ―a radical\nredistribution of wealth‖ is presented in a widely cited essay entitled ―In Defense of Equality.‖\n❶The most striking feature of Walzer‘s critique is that, far from rejecting the principle of reward according\nto merit, Walzer insists on its validity. ❷People who excel should receive the superior benefits appropriate to\ntheir excellence. ❸But people exhibit a great variety of qualities—―intelligence, physical strength, agility and\ngrace, artistic creativity, mechanical skill, leadership, endurance, memory, psychological insight, the capacity for\nhard work—even moral strength, sensitivity, the ability to express compassion.‖ ❹Each deserves its proper\nrecompense, and hence a proper distribution of material goods should reflect human differences as measured\non all these different scales. ❺Yet, under capitalism, the ability to make money (―the green thumb (an unusual\nability to make plants grow) of bourgeois society‖) enables its possessor to acquire almost ―every other sort of\nsocial good,‖ such as the respect and esteem of others.\n❶The centerpiece of Walzer‘s argument is the invocation of a quotation from Pascal‘s Pensees, which\nconcludes: ―Tyranny is the wish to obtain by one means what can only be had by another.‖ ❷Pascal believes\nthat we owe different duties to different qualities. ❸So we might say that infatuation is the proper response to\ncharm, and awe the proper response to strength. ❹In this light, Walzer characterizes capitalism as the tyranny of\nmoney (or of the ability to make it). ❺And Walzer advocates as the means of eliminating this tyranny and of\nrestoring genuine equality ―the abolition of the power of money outside its sphere.‖ ❻What Walzer envisions is\na society in which wealth is no longer convertible into social goods with which it has no intrinsic connection.\n❶Walzer‘s argument is a puzzling one. ❷After all, why should those qualities unrelated to the production\nof material goods be rewarded with material goods? ❸Is it not tyrannical, in Pascal‘s sense, to insist that those\nwho excel in ―sensitivity‖ or ―the ability to express compassion‖ merit equal wealth with those who excel in\nqualities (such as ―the capacity for hard work‖) essential in producing wealth? ❹Yet Walzer‘s argument,\nhowever deficient, does point to one of the most serious weaknesses of capitalism—namely, that it brings to\npredominant positions in a society people who, no matter how legitimately they have earned their material\nrewards, often lack those other qualities that evoke affection or admiration. ❺Some even argue plausibly that\nthis weakness may be irremediable: in any society that, like a capitalist society, seeks to become ever wealthier","\fin material terms disproportionate rewards are bound to flow to the people who are instrumental in producing the\nincrease in its wealth.","\f21.
