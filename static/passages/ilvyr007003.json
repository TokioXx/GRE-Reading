Pessen in his iconoclastic\nstudy of the very rich in the United States between 1825 and 1850.","❶Pessen does present a quantity of examples, together with some refreshingly intelligible statistics, to establish\nthe existence of an inordinately wealthy class. ❷Though active in commerce or the professions, most of the\nwealthy were not self-made, but had inherited family fortunes. ❸In no sense mercurial, these great fortunes\nsurvived the financial panics that destroyed lesser ones. ❹Indeed, in several cities the wealthiest one percent\nconstantly increased its share until by 1850 it owned half of the community‘s wealth. ❺Although these\nobservations are true, Pessen overestimates their importance by concluding from them that the undoubted\nprogress toward inequality in the late eighteenth century continued in the Jacksonian period and that the United\nStates was a class-ridden, plutocratic society even before industrialization.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" According to the passage, Pessen indicates that all of the following were true of the very wealthy in the\nUnited States between 1825 and 1850 EXCEPT:\n","options":["They formed a distinct upper class.\n","Many of them were able to increase their holdings.\n","Some of them worked as professionals or in business.\n","Most of them accumulated their own fortunes.\n","Many of them retained their wealth in spite of financial upheavals.\n"]},{"subject":" The author‘s attitude toward Pessen‘s presentation of statistics can be best described as\n","options":["disapproving\n","shocked\n","suspicious\n","amused\n","laudatory\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following best states the author‘s main point?\n","options":["Pessen‘s study has overturned the previously established view of the social and economic structure of\nearly nineteenth-century America.\n","Tocqueville‘s analysis of the United States in the Jacksonian era remains the definitive account of this\nperiod.\n","Pessen‘s study is valuable primarily because it shows the continuity of the social system in the United\nStates throughout the nineteenth century.\n","The social patterns and political power of the extremely wealthy in the United States between 1825 and\n1850 are well documented.\n","Pessen challenges a view of the social and economic system in the United States from 1825 to 1850, but\nhe draws conclusions that are incorrect.\n\n\f"]}],"answers":["D","E","E"]}
