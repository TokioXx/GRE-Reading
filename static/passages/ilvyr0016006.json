{"id":"ilvyr0016006","title":"天文学因素导致地球气候存在周期","content":["\nThis passage is based on an article published in 1990.\n❶Eight times within the past million years, something in the Earth‘s climatic equation has changed, allowing\nsnow in the mountains and the northern latitudes to accumulate from one season to the next instead of melting\naway. ❷Each time, the enormous ice sheets resulting from this continual buildup lasted tens of thousands of\nyears until the end of each particular glacial cycle brought a warmer climate. ❸Scientists speculated that these\nglacial cycles were ultimately driven by astronomical factors: slow, cyclic changes in the eccentricity of the\nEarth‘s orbit and in the tilt and orientation of its spin axis. ❹But up until around 30 years ago, the lack of an\nindependent record of ice-age timing made the hypothesis untestable.","❶Then in the early 1950‘s Emiliani produced the first complete record of the waxings and wanings of past\nglaciations. ❷It came from a seemingly odd place, the seafloor. ❸Single-cell marine organisms called\n―foraminifera‖ house themselves in shells made from calcium carbonate. ❹When the foraminifera die, sink to\nthe bottom, and become part of seafloor sediments, the carbonate of their shells preserves certain characteristics\nof the seawater they inhabited. ❺In particular, the ratio of a heavy isotope of oxygen (oxygen-18) to ordinary\noxygen (oxygen-16) in the carbonate preserves the ratio of the two oxygens in water molecules.","❶It is now understood that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in seawater closely reflects the proportion of the\nworld‘s water locked up in glaciers and ice sheets. ❷A kind of meteorological distillation accounts for the link.\n❸Water molecules containing the heavier isotope tend to condense and fall as precipitation slightly sooner than\nmolecules containing the lighter isotope. ❹Hence, as water vapor evaporated from warm oceans moves away\nfrom its source, its oxygen-18 returns more quickly to the oceans than does its oxygen-16. ❺What falls as snow\non distant ice sheets and mountain glaciers is relatively depleted of oxygen-18. ❻As the oxygen-18-poor ice\nbuilds up, the oceans become relatively enriched in the isotope. ❼The larger the ice sheets grow, the higher the\nproportion of oxygen-18 becomes in seawater—and hence in the sediments.","❶Analyzing cores drilled from seafloor sediments, Emiliani found that the isotopic ratio rose and fell in rough\naccord with the Earth‘s astronomical cycles. ❷Since that pioneering observation, oxygen-isotope\nmeasurements have been made on hundreds of cores. ❸","\f17.
