Three facts are salient. ❷First, dwarf galaxies and globular clusters, into which most of the stars of the\nMilky Way‘s corona are probably bound, consist mainly of old stars. ❸Second, old stars are not highly\nluminous. ❹Third, no one has detected in the corona the clouds of gaseous matter such as hydrogen and carbon\nmonoxide that are characteristic of the bright parts of a galaxy. ❺At present, therefore, the best\nexplanation—though still quite tentative—for the darkness of the corona is that the corona is composed mainly\nof old, burned-out stars.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" The passage as a whole is primarily concerned with\n","options":["analyzing a current debate\n","criticizing a well-established theory\n","showing how new facts support a previously dismissed hypothesis\n","stating a conclusion and adducing evidence that may justify it\n","contrasting two types of phenomena and showing how they are related\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, a bright part of a galaxy typically includes\n","options":["dwarf galaxies and clusters of stars\n","a balanced mixture of old and new stars\n","a large portion of the galaxy‘s mass\n","part of the corona of the galaxy\n","gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that, compared with what they now think, until fairly recently\nastronomers believed that the Milky Way\n","options":["was much darker\n","was much smaller\n","was moving much more slowly\n","had a much larger corona\n","had much less gaseous matter\n"]},{"subject":" The passage presents which of the following as incontrovertible?\nI.\n\nThe low luminosity of old stars\n\nII.\n\nThe absence of clouds of gaseous matter from the corona of the Milky Way\n\nIII.
