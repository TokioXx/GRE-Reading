{"id":"ilvyr0014005","title":"二氧化碳增加，导致全球变暖","content":["\n❶The molecules of carbon dioxide in the Earth‘s atmosphere affect the heat balance of the Earth by acting as a\none-way screen. ❷Although these molecules allow radiation at visible wavelengths, where most of the energy\nof sunlight is concentrated, to pass through, they absorb some of the longer-wavelength, infrared emissions\nradiated from the Earth‘s surface, radiation that would otherwise be transmitted back into space. ❸For the Earth\nto maintain a constant average temperature, such emissions from the planet must balance incoming solar\nradiation. ❹If there were no carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, heat would escape from the Earth much more\neasily. ❺The surface temperature would be so much lower that the oceans might be a solid mass of ice.","❶Today, however, the potential problem is too much carbon dioxide. ❷The burning of fossil fuels and the\nclearing of forests have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 15 percent in the last hundred years, and\nwe continue to add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. ❸Could the increase in carbon dioxide cause a global rise\nin average temperature, and could such a rise have serious consequences for human society? ❹Mathematical\nmodels that allow us to calculate the rise in temperature as a function of the increase indicate that the answer is\nprobably yes.","❶Under present conditions a temperature of-18℃ can be observed at an altitude of 5 to 6 kilometers above the\nEarth. ❷Below this altitude (called the radiating level), the temperature increases by about 6℃ per kilometer\napproaching the Earth‘s surface, where the average temperature is about 15℃. ❸An increase in the amount of\ncarbon dioxide means that there are more molecules of carbon dioxide to absorb infrared radiation. ❹As the\ncapacity of the atmosphere to absorb infrared radiation increases, the radiating level and the temperature of the\nsurface must rise.\n❶One mathematical model predicts that doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide would raise the global mean\nsurface temperature by 2.5℃. ❷This model assumes that the atmosphere‘s relative humidity remains constant\nand the temperature decreases with altitude at a rate of 6.5℃ per kilometer. ❸The assumption of constant\nrelative humidity is important, because water vapor in the atmosphere is another efficient absorber of radiation at\ninfrared wavelengths. ❹Because warm air can hold more moisture than cool air, the relative humidity will be\nconstant only if the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases as the temperature rises. ❺Therefore,\nmore infrared radiation would be absorbed and reradiated back to the Earth‘s surface. ❻The resultant warming\nat the surface could be expected to melt snow and ice, reducing the Earth‘s reflectivity. ❼More solar radiation\nwould then be absorbed, leading to a further increase in temperature.","\f17.
