{"id":"ilvyr0014007","title":"介绍电子晶体的性质","content":["\n❶One of the simplest and best known kinds of crystal is the ionic salt, of which a typical example is sodium\nchloride or ordinary table salt. ❷The fundamental components of an ionic salt are ions: atoms or molecules that\nhave become electrically charged by gaining or losing one or more electrons. ❸In forming sodium chloride, for\nexample, sodium atoms give up an electron (thereby becoming positively charged) and chlorine atoms gain an\nelectron (thereby becoming negatively charged). ❹The ions are attracted to one another by their opposite\ncharges, and they stack together compactly, like tightly packed spheres.","❶Recently, scientists at Michigan State University created a new kind of crystal called an electride. ❷In\nelectrides, the anions (negative ions) are completely replaced by electrons, which are trapped in naturally formed\ncavities within a framework of regularly stacked cations (positive ions). ❸Electrides are the first examples of\nionic salts in which all these anionic sites are occupied solely by electrons.","❶Unlike other types of anions, anionic electrons do not behave as if they were simple charged spheres. ❷In\nparticular, because of their low mass and their tendency to interact with one another over great distances, they\ncannot be ―pinned down‖ to any one location. ❸Instead, they wander close to and among the atoms lining the\ncavity and interact with electrons in nearby cavities, perhaps changing places with them.","❶The properties of an electride depend largely on the distance between the cavities that hold trapped electrons.\n❷When the trapped electrons are far apart, they do not interact strongly, and so behave somewhat like an array\nof isolated negative charges. ❸When they are closer together, they begin to display properties associated with\nlarge ensembles of identical particles. ❹When they are still closer, the ensemble properties dominate and the\nelectrons ―delocalize‖: they are no longer tightly bound within individual cavities but are more or less free to\npass through the spaces within the frame-work of positive ions.","❶By synthesizing electrides from a variety of materials, one can vary the geometry of the anionic cavities and\ntheir relation to the surrounding cations. ❷The resulting properties may make it possible for electrides to\nbecome a basis for economically useful new materials and devices. ❸For instance, because the electrons in\nsome electrides are very weakly bound, these crystals could be effective as photosensitive detectors, in which an\nimpinging photon liberates an electron, resulting in a small electric current. ❹The same weak binding could\nalso make electrides useful in solar-energy converters and as cathodes in batteries. ❺One obstacle is the\ntendency of electrides to decompose through reaction with air and water. ❻Researchers are seeking ways to\nincrease their stability.","\f21.
