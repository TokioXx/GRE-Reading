{"id":"ilvyr003003","title":"可以通过法庭记录的个案来对大众阶层进行研究","content":["\n❶In the early 1950‘s, historians who studied preindustrial Europe (which we may define here as Europe in the\nperiod from roughly 1300 to 1800) began, for the first time in large numbers, to investigate more of the\npreindustrial European population than the 2 or 3 percent who comprised the political and social elite: the kings,\ngenerals, judges, nobles, bishops, and local magnates who had hitherto usually filled history books. ❷One\ndifficulty, however, was that few of the remaining 97 percent recorded their thoughts or had them chronicled by\ncontemporaries. ❸Faced with this situation, many historians based their investigations on the only records that\nseemed to exist: birth, marriage, and death records. ❹As a result, much of the early work on the nonelite was\naridly statistical in nature; reducing the vast majority of the population to a set of numbers was hardly more\nenlightening than ignoring them altogether. ❺Historians still did not know what these people thought or felt.\n❶One way out of this dilemma was to turn to the records of legal courts, for here the voices of the nonelite can\nmost often be heard, as witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants. ❷These documents have acted as ―a point of entry\ninto the mental world of the poor.‖ ❸Historians such as Le Roy Ladurie have used the documents to extract\ncase histories, which have illuminated the attitudes of different social groups (these attitudes include, but\nare not confined to, attitudes toward crime and the law) and have revealed how the authorities\nadministered justice. ❹It has been societies that have had a developed police system and practiced Roman law,\nwith its written depositions, whose court records have yielded the most data to historians. ❺In Anglo-Saxon\ncountries hardly any of these benefits obtain, but it has still been possible to glean information from the study of\nlegal documents.\n❶The extraction of case histories is not, however, the only use to which court records may be put. ❷Historians\nwho study preindustrial Europe have used the records to establish a series of categories of crime and to quantify\nindictments that were issued over a given number of years.\n❶This use of the records does yield some information about the nonelite, but this information gives us little\ninsight into the mental lives of the nonelite. ❷We also know that the number of indictments in preindustrial\nEurope bears little relation to the number of actual criminal acts, and we strongly suspect that the relationship\nhas varied widely over time. ❸In addition, aggregate population estimates are very shaky, which makes it\ndifficult for historians to compare rates of crime per thousand in one decade of the preindustrial period with rates\nin another decade. ❹Given these inadequacies, it is clear why the case history use of court records is to be\npreferred.","\f21.
