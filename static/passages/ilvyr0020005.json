{"id":"ilvyr0020005","title":"有四种途径可以把技术进步引导到对社会有用的方向","content":["\n❶Four legal approaches may be followed in attempting to channel technological development in socially\nuseful direction: specific directives, market incentive modifications, criminal prohibitions, and changes in\ndecision-making structures. ❷Specific directives involve the government‘s identifying one or more factors\ncontrolling research, development, or implementation of a given technology. ❸Directives affecting such factors\nmay vary from administrative regulation of private activity to government ownership of a technological\noperation. ❹Market incentive modifications are deliberate alterations of the market within which private\ndecisions regarding the development and implementation of technology are made. ❺Such modifications may\nconsist of imposing taxes to cover the costs to society of a given technology, granting subsidies to pay for social\nbenefits of a technology, creating the right to sue to prevent certain technological development, or easing\nprocedural rules to enable the recovery of damages to compensate for harm caused by destructive technological\nactivity. ❻Criminal prohibitions may modify technological activity in areas impinging on fundamental social\nvalues, or they may modify human behavior likely to result from technological applications—for example, the\ndeactivation of automotive pollution control devices in order to improve vehicle performance. ❼Alteration of\ndecision-making structures includes all possible modifications in the authority, constitution, or responsibility of\nprivate and public entities deciding questions of technological development and implementation. ❽Such\nalterations include the addition of public-interest members to corporate boards, the imposition by statute of\nduties on governmental decision-makers, and the extension of warranties in response to consumer action.\n❶Effective use of these methods to control technology depends on whether or not the goal of regulation is\nthe optimal allocation of resources. ❷When the object is optimal resource allocation, that combination of legal\nmethods should be used that most nearly yields the allocation that would exist if there were no external costs\nresulting from allocating resources through market activity. ❸There are external costs when the price set by\nbuyers and sellers of goods fails to include some costs, to anyone, that result from the production and use of the\ngoods. ❹Such costs are internalized when buyers pay them.\n❶Air pollution from motor vehicles imposes external costs on all those exposed to it, in the form of\nsoiling, materials damage, and disease: these externalities result from failure to place a price on air, thus making\nit a free good, common to all. ❷Such externalities lead to nonoptimal resource allocation, because the private\nnet product and the social net product of market activity are not often identical. ❸If all externalities were\ninternalized, transactions would occur until bargaining could no longer improve the situation, thus giving an\noptimal allocation of resources at a given time.","\f17.
