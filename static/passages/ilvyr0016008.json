That was not necessarily to\nknow it.‖ ❸ This disparity between an experience and knowledge of that experience is the longest bridge an\nartist must cross. ❹Don L. Lee, in his picture of the Black poet, ―studying his own poetry and the poetry of\nother Black poets,‖ touches on the crucial point. ❺In order to transform his own sufferings—or joys—as a\nBlack person into usable knowledge for his readers, the author must first order his experiences in his mind.\n❻Only then can he create feelingly and coherently the combination of fact and meaning that Black audiences\nrequire for the re-exploration of their lives. ❼A cultural community of Black authors studying one another‘s\nbest works systematically would represent a dynamic interchange of the spirit—corrective and instructive and\nincreasingly beautiful in its recorded expression."],"questions":[{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the author considers poetry to be which of the following?\n","options":["A means of diversion in which suffering is transformed into joy\n","An art form that sometimes stifles creative energy\n","A bridge between the mundane and the unreal\n","A medium for conveying important information\n","An area where beauty must be sacrificed for accuracy\n"]},{"subject":" It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to approve of which of the\nfollowing?\n","options":["Courses that promote cultural awareness through the study of contemporary art\n","The development of creative writing courses that encourage mutual criticism of student work\n","Growing interest in extemporaneous writing that records experiences as they occur\n","A shift in interest from abstract philosophical poetry to concrete autobiographical poetry\n","Workshops and newsletters designed to promote dialogues between poets\n"]},{"subject":" The author refers to Henry James primarily in order to\n","options":["support his own perception of the ―longest bridge‖\n","illustrate a coherent ―combination of fact and meaning‖\n","provide an example of ―dynamic interchange of the spirit‖\n","establish the pervasiveness of lack of self-knowledge\n","contrast James‘s ideas about poetry with those of Don L.
