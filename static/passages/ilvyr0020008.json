{"id":"ilvyr0020008","title":"青少年发展政治意识所需要的因素","content":["\n❶During adolescence, the development of political ideology becomes apparent in the individual; ideology\nhere is defined as the presence of roughly consistent attitudes, more or less organized in reference to a more\nencompassing, though perhaps tacit, set of general principles. ❷As such, political ideology is dim or absent at\nthe beginning of adolescence. ❸Its acquisition by the adolescent, in even the most modest sense, requires the\nacquisition of relatively sophisticated cognitive skills: the ability to manage abstractness, to synthesize and\ngeneralize, to imagine the future. ❹These are accompanied by a steady advance in the ability to understand\nprinciples.\n❶The child‘s rapid acquisition of political knowledge also promotes the growth of political ideology\nduring adolescence. ❷By knowledge I mean more than the dreary ―facts,‖ such as the composition of county\ngovernment that the child is exposed to in the conventional ninth-grade civics course. ❸Nor do I mean only\ninformation on current political realities. ❹These are facets of knowledge, but they are less critical than the\nadolescent‘s absorption, often unwitting, of a feeling for those many unspoken assumptions about the political\nsystem that comprise the common ground of understanding—for example, what the state can appropriately\ndemand of its citizens, and vice versa, or the proper relationship of government to subsidiary social institutions,\nsuch as the schools and churches. ❺Thus political knowledge is the awareness of social assumptions and\nrelationships as well as of objective facts. ❻Much of the naiveté that characterizes the younger adolescent‘s\ngrasp of politics stems not from an ignorance of ―facts‖ but from conventions of the system, of what is and is not\ncustomarily done, and of how and why it is or is not done.\n❶Yet I do not want to overemphasize the significance of increased political knowledge in forming\nadolescent ideology. ❷Over the years I have become progressively disenchanted about the centrality of such\nknowledge and have come to believe that much current work in political socialization, by relying too heavily on\nits apparent acquisition, has been misled about the tempo of political understanding in adolescence. ❸Just as\nyoung children can count numbers in series without grasping the principle of ordination, young adolescents may\nhave in their heads many random bits of political information without a secure understanding of those concepts\nthat would give order and meaning to the information.\n❶Like magpies, children‘s minds pick up bits and pieces of data. ❷If you encourage them, they will drop\nthese at your feet—Republicans and Democrats, the tripartite division of the federal system, perhaps even the\ncapital of Massachusetts. ❸But until the adolescent has grasped the integumental function that concepts and\nprinciples provide, the data remain fragmented, random, disordered.","\f21.
