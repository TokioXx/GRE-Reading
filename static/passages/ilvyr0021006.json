{"id":"ilvyr0021006","title":"小说Remembrance如何从散文体裁变成小说体裁","content":["\n❶Many literary detectives have pored over a great puzzle concerning the writer Marcel Proust: what\nhappened in 1909? ❷How did Contre Saint-Beuve, an essay attacking the methods of the critic Saint Beuve,\nturn into the start of the novel Remembrance of Things Past? ❸A recently published letter from Proust to the\neditor Vallette confirms that Fallois, the editor of the 1954 edition of Contre Saint-Beuve, made an essentially\ncorrect guess about the relationship of the essay to the novel. ❹Fallois proposed that Proust had tried to begin a\nnovel in 1908, abandoned it for what was to be a long demonstration of Saint-Beuve‘s blindness to the real\nnature of great writing, found the essay giving rise to personal memories and fictional developments, and\nallowed these to take over in a steadily developing novel.\n❶Draft passages in Proust‘s 1909 notebooks indicate that the transition from essay to novel began in\nContre Saint-Beuve, when Proust introduced several examples to show the powerful influence that involuntary\nmemory exerts over the creative imagination. ❷In effect, in trying to demonstrate that the imagination is more\nprofound and less submissive to the intellect than Saint-Beuve assumed, Proust elicited vital memories of his\nown and, finding subtle connections between them, began to amass the material for Remembrance. ❸By August,\nProust was writing to Vallette, informing him of his intention to develop the material as a novel. ❹Maurice\nBardeche, in Marcel Proust, romancier, has shown the importance in the drafts of Remembrance of spontaneous\nand apparently random associations of Proust‘s subconscious. ❺As incidents and reflections occurred to Proust,\nhe continually inserted new passages altering and expanding his narrative. ❻But he found it difficult to control\nthe drift of his inspiration. ❼The very richness and complexity of the meaningful relationships that kept\npresenting and rearranging themselves on all levels, from abstract intelligence to profound dreamy feelings,\nmade it difficult for Proust to set them out coherently. ❽The beginning of control came when he saw how to\nconnect the beginning and the end of his novel.\n❶Intrigued by Proust‘s claim that he had ―begun and finished‖ Remembrance at the same time, Henri\nBonnet discovered that parts of Remembrance’s last book were actually started in 1909. ❷Already in that year,\nProust had drafted descriptions of his novel‘s characters in their old age that would appear in the final book of\nRemembrance, where the permanence of art is set against the ravages of time. ❸The letter to Vallette, drafts of\nthe essay and novel, and Bonnet‘s researches establish in broad outline the process by which Proust generated\nhis novel out of the ruins of his essay. ❹But those of us who hoped, with Kolb, that Kolb‘s newly published\ncomplete edition of Proust‘s correspondence for 1909 would document the process in greater detail are\ndisappointed. ❺For until Proust was confident that he was at last in sight of a viable structure for Remembrance,\nhe told few correspondents that he was producing anything more ambitious than Contre Saint-Beuve.","\f21.
