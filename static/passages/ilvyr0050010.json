{"id":"ilvyr0050010","title":"私人投资可以使基础设施建设更为灵活","content":["\n❶Although the development of new infrastructure (such public facilities as power plants, schools, and bridges)\nis usually determined by governmental planning, sometimes this development can be planned more flexibly\nand realistically by private investors who anticipate profit from the collection of user fees. ❷Such profits can\ncontribute to the financing of more infrastructure if demand proves great enough, whereas the reluctance of\ndevelopers to invest in such projects can signal that additional infrastructure is not needed. ❸During the\neconomic boom of the 1980‘s, for example, the state of Virginia authorized private developers to build a $300\nmillion toll road. ❹These developers obtained the needed right-of-way from property owners, but by 1993 they\nstill had not raised the necessary financing. ❺The unwillingness of investors to finance this project does not\nnegate the viability of privately financed roads; rather, it illustrates a virtue of private financing. ❻If a road\nappears unlikely to attract enough future traffic to pay for the road, then it should not be built."],"questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to\n","options":["build a case for increasing the development of new infrastructure\n","advocate an alternative to government financing of infrastructure\n","explain the failure of a privately financed venture\n","suggest the types of infrastructure most appropriate for private financing\n","argue against government restrictions on developing new infrastructure\n"]},{"subject":" The passage implies that the ―governmental planning‖ mentioned in highlighted portion may lead to which\nof the following problems?\n","options":["Improper use of profits derived from user fees\n","Unduly slow development of necessary new infrastructure\n","Unrealistic decisions about developing new infrastructure\n","Incorrect predictions about profits to be gained from user fees\n","Obstruction of private financing for the development of new infrastructure\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, which of the following is true of the toll road mentioned in highlighted portion?\n","options":["After it was built, it attracted too little traffic to pay for its construction.\n","It was partially financed by the state of Virginia.\n","Its development was authorized during an economic boom.\n","Its construction was controversial among local residents.\n","Its developers were discouraged by governmental restrictions on acquiring the necessary land.\n"]},{"subject":" The passage suggests that which of the following would occur if a privately financed bridge that proved to\nbe profitable failed after a number of years to meet the demands of traffic?\n","options":["Private developers who financed the bridge would rely on governmental authorities to develop new\ninfrastructure.\n","User fees would be increased so that usage would become more costly.\n","Governmental authorities would be reluctant to rely on private contractors to develop a new bridge.\n","The success of the project would be jeopardized by public dissatisfaction with the project‘s adequacy.\n\n\f(E) Profits generated by user fees would be used to help finance the construction of new infrastructure to\nalleviate the traffic problem.\n\n\f"]}],"answers":["B","C","C","E"]}
