{"id":"ilvyr00210010","title":"热量和水蒸气与上方空气的转移原理","content":["\n❶The transfer of heat and water vapor from the ocean to the air above it depends on a disequilibrium at the\ninterface of the water and the air. ❷Within about a millimeter of the water, air temperature is close to that of the\nsurface water, and the air is nearly saturated with water vapor. ❸But the differences, however small, are crucial,\nand the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically\nappreciably cooler and lower in water-vapor content. ❹The air is mixed by means of turbulence that depends on\nthe wind for its energy. ❺As wind speed increases, so does turbulence, and thus the rate of heat and moisture\ntransfer. ❻Detailed understanding of this phenomenon awaits further study. ❼An interacting—and\ncomplicating—phenomenon is wind-to-water transfer of momentum that occurs when waves are formed.\n❽When the wind makes waves, it transfers important amounts of energy—energy that is therefore not available\nto provide turbulence."],"questions":[{"subject":" The primary purpose of the passage is to\n","options":["resolve a controversy\n","describe a phenomenon\n","outline a theory\n","confirm research findings\n","classify various observations\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, wind over the ocean generally does which of the following?\nI.\n\n","options":["auses relatively cool, dry air to come into proximity with the ocean surface.\n\nII.\n\nMaintains a steady rate of heat and moisture transfer between the ocean and the air.\n\nIII.
