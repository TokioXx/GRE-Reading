{"id":"ilvyr002004","title":"甲醇可以大大降低污染","content":["\n❶Although, recent years have seen substantial reductions in noxious pollutants from individual motor vehicles,\nthe number of such vehicles has been steadily increasing consequently, more than 100 cities in the United States\nstill have levels of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone (generated by photochemical reactions with\nhydrocarbons from vehicle exhaust) that exceed legally established limits. ❷There is a growing realization that\nthe only effective way to achieve further reductions in vehicle emissions—short of a massive shift away from the\nprivate automobile—is to replace conventional diesel fuel and gasoline with cleaner-burning fuels such as\ncompressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol, or methanol.","❶All of these alternatives are carbon-based fuels whose molecules are smaller and simpler than those of\ngasoline. ❷These molecules burn more cleanly than gasoline, in part because they have fewer, if any,\ncarbon-carbon bonds, and the hydrocarbons they do emit are less likely to generate ozone. ❸The combustion of\nlarger molecules, which have multiple carbon-carbon bonds, involves a more complex series of reactions.\n❹These reactions increase the probability of incomplete combustion and are more likely to release\nuncombusted and photochemically active hydrocarbon compounds into the atmosphere. ❺On the other hand,\nalternative fuels do have drawbacks. ❻Compressed natural gas would require that vehicles have a set of heavy\nfuel tanks—a serious liability in terms of performance and fuel efficiency—and liquefied petroleum gas faces\nfundamental limits on supply.","❶Ethanol and methanol, on the other hand, have important advantages over other carbon-based alternative fuels:\nthey have a higher energy content per volume and would require minimal changes in the existing network for\ndistributing motor fuel. ❷Ethanol is commonly used as a gasoline supplement, but it is currently about twice as\nexpensive as methanol, the low cost of which is one of its attractive features. ❸Methanol‘s most attractive\nfeature, however, is that it can reduce by about 90 percent the vehicle emissions that form ozone, the most\nserious urban air pollutant.","❶Like any alternative fuel, methanol has its critics. ❷Yet much of the criticism is based on the use of\n―gasoline clone‖ vehicles that do not incorporate even the simplest design improvements that are made possible\nwith the use of methanol. ❸It is true, for example, that a given volume of methanol provides only about\none-half of the energy that gasoline and diesel fuel do; other things being equal, the fuel tank would have to be\nsomewhat larger and heavier. ❹However, since methanol-fueled vehicles could be designed to be much more\nefficient than ―gasoline clone‖ vehicles fueled with methanol, they would need comparatively less fuel.\n❺Vehicles incorporating only the simplest of the engine improvements that methanol makes feasible would still\ncontribute to an immediate lessening of urban air pollution.","\f17.
