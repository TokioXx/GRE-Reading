{"id":"ilvyr0015005","title":"神经发育系统中存在追求精确性和避免错误之间的权衡","content":["\n❶The more that is discovered about the intricate organization of the nervous system, the more it seems\nremarkable that genes can successfully specify the development of that system. ❷Human genes contain too\nlittle information even to specify which hemisphere of the brain each of a human‘s 1011 neurons should occupy,\nlet alone the hundreds of connections that each neuron makes. ❷For such reasons, we can assume that there\nmust be an important random factor in neural development, and in particular, that errors must and do occur in the\ndevelopment of all normal brains.\n❶The most vivid expression of such errors occurs in genetically identical (isogenic) organisms. ❷Even when\nreared under the same conditions, isogenic organisms are rarely exact copies of one another, and their differences\nhave revealed much about the random variations that result from an organism‘s limited supply of genetic\ninformation. ❸In isogenic Daphniae, for example, even though the position, size, and branching pattern of each\noptic neuron are remarkably constant, there is some variability in connectivity, and the number of synapses\nvaries greatly. ❹This variability is probably the result of random scatter beyond the resolution of genetic control\nand is best termed ―imprecision,‖ since its converse, the degree of clustering about a mean, is conventionally,\ncalled ―precision.‖\n❶Imprecision should be distinguished from developmental mistakes: wrongly migrated neurons, incorrect\nconnections, and the like. ❷To use a computer analogy, minor rounding-off errors occur universally and are\nanalogous to imprecision, but occasionally a binary digit is incorrectly transmitted, perhaps ruining a calculation,\nand this incorrect transmission is analogous to a developmental mistake. ❸Thus, imprecision is a form of\ninaccuracy inherent within the limits of design, but mistakes are forms of gross fallibility.\n❶Both imprecision and gross fallibility can plausibly be blamed on the insufficiency of genetic information,\nsince either could be reduced by adding more information. ❷It is universally accepted among information\ntheorists that codes and languages can be made mistake-resistant by incorporating redundancy. ❸However,\nsince the amount of space available in any information system is limited, increased redundancy results in\ndecreased precision. ❹For example, π when written incorrectly in English, ―three point oen four two, ―can be\nunderstood correctly even though a typographical error has occurred. ❺More precision could be gained,\nhowever, if those 24 spaces were filled with Arabic numerals; then π could be expressed to 23 significant digits,\nalthough any error would significantly change the meaning. ❻There exists a trade-off, the more precisely a\nsystem is specified, using a given limited amount of information, the greater the danger of gross mistakes.\n❼The overall scheme by which genetic information is rationed out in organisms, therefore, must involve a\ncompromise between two conflicting priorities: precision and the avoidance of gross mistakes.","\f17. Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?\n(A) Although studies of isogenic organisms have shown that all organisms are subject to developmental\nvariations, there is still scientific debate over the exact causes of these variations.\n(B) Because of limitations on the amount of information contained in the genes of organisms, developing\nnervous systems are subject to two basic kinds of error, the likelihood of one of which is reduced only\nwhen the likelihood of the other is increased.\n(C) The complexity of an organism‘s genetic information means that much of the unusual variation that\noccurs among organisms can best be explained as the result of developmental mistakes.\n(D) New findings about the nature of the genetic control of neural development support the work of some\nscientists who argue that the computer is an extremely useful model for understanding the nervous\nsystem.\n(E) The major discovery made by scientists studying the genetic control of neural development is that both\nimprecision and gross developmental error can be traced to specific types of mutations in specific\ngenes.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" According to the passage, one of the reasons it has been assumed that there is an important random element\nin human neural development is that\n","options":["genes cannot specify certain types of developmental processes as well as they can others\n","the intricacy of the nervous system allows small developmental errors to occur without harmful effects\n","the amount of information contained in the genes is less than the amount necessary to specify the\nlocation of the neurons\n","the number of neurons in the human brain varies greatly from individual to individual\n","it is theoretically impossible for an organism to protect itself completely from gross developmental\nmistakes\n"]},{"subject":" The author suggests which of the following about the findings of information theorists?\n","options":["Their findings provocatively challenge the standard explanation of redundancy in genes.\n","Their findings provide useful insights into understanding the rationing of genetic information.\n","Their findings help to explain why imprecision can occur in neural development but not why gross\nmistakes can occur.\n","Their findings suggest that genes may be able to specify neural development more accurately than had\npreviously been thought.\n","Their findings support the work of those who use computer operations as models for understanding\ngenetic control.\n"]},{"subject":" According to the passage, of the following aspects of the optic neurons of isogenic Daphniae, which varies\nthe most?\n","options":["Size\n","Connectivity\n","Position\n","Branching pattern\n","Number of synapses\n\n\f21.
