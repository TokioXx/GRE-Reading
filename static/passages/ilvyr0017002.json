{"id":"ilvyr0017002","title":"Thomas Hardy对创作中的冲动缺乏控制力","content":["\n❶Thomas Hardy‘s impulses as a writer, all of which he indulged in his novels, were numerous and divergent,\nand they did not always work together in harmony. ❷Hardy was to some degree interested in exploring his\ncharacters‘ psychologies, though impelled less by curiosity than by sympathy. ❸Occasionally he felt the\nimpulse to comedy (in all its detached coldness) as well as the impulse to farce, but he was more often inclined\nto see tragedy and record it. ❹He was also inclined to literary realism in the several senses of that phrase. ❺He\nwanted to describe ordinary human beings; he wanted to speculate on their dilemmas rationally (and,\nunfortunately, even schematically); and he wanted to record precisely the material universe. ❻Finally, he\nwanted to be more than a realist. ❼He wanted to transcend what he considered to be the banality of solely\nrecording things exactly and to express as well his awareness of the occult and the strange.\n❶In his novels these various impulses were sacrificed to each other inevitably and often. ❷Inevitably, because\nHardy did not care in the way that novelists such as Flaubert or James cared, and therefore took paths of least\nresistance. ❸Thus, one impulse often surrendered to a fresher one and, unfortunately, instead of exacting\na compromise, simply disappeared. ❹A desire to throw over reality a light that never was might give way\nabruptly to the desire on the part of what we might consider a novelist-scientist to record exactly and\nconcretely the structure and texture of a flower. ❺In this instance, the new impulse was at least an\nenergetic one, and thus its indulgence did not result in a relaxed style. ❻But on other occasions Hardy\nabandoned a perilous, risky, and highly energizing impulse in favor of what was for him the fatally\nrelaxing impulse to classify and schematize abstractly. ❼When a relaxing impulse was indulged, the\nstyle—that sure index of an author‘s literary worth—was certain to become verbose. ❽Hardy‘s weakness\nderived from his apparent inability to control the comings and goings of these divergent impulses and from his\nunwillingness to cultivate and sustain the energetic and risky ones. ❾He submitted to first one and then another,\nand the spirit blew where it listed; hence the unevenness of any one of his novels. ❿His most controlled novel,\nUnder the Greenwood Tree, prominently exhibits two different but reconcilable impulses—a desire to be a\nrealist-historian and a desire to be a psychologist of love—but the slight interlockings of plot are not enough to\nbind the two completely together.11\n○ Thus even this book splits into two distinct parts.","\f17.
