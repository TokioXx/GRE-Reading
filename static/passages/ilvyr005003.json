{"id":"ilvyr005003","title":"铝土矿很有价值","content":["\n❶Eight percent of the Earth‘s crust is aluminum, and there are hundreds of aluminum-bearing minerals and vast\nquantities of the rocks that contain them. ❷The best aluminum ore is bauxite, defined as aggregates of\naluminous minerals, more or less impure, in which aluminum is present as hydrated oxides. ❸Bauxite is the\nrichest of all those aluminous rocks that occur in large quantities, and it yields alumina, the intermediate product\nrequired for the production of aluminum. ❹Alumina also occurs naturally as the mineral corundum, but\ncorundum is not found in large deposits of high purity, and therefore it is an impractical source for making\naluminum. ❺Most of the many abundant non-bauxite aluminous minerals are silicates, and, like all silicate\nminerals, they are refractory, resistant to analysis, and extremely difficult to process. ❻The aluminum silicates\nare therefore generally unsuitable alternatives to bauxite because considerably more energy is required to extract\nalumina from them.\n"],"questions":[{"subject":" The author implies that a mineral must either be or readily supply which of the following in order to be\nclassified as an aluminum ore?\n","options":["An aggregate\n","Bauxite\n","Alumina\n","Corundum\n","An aluminum silicate\n"]},{"subject":" The passage supplies information for answering all of the following questions regarding aluminous minerals\n","options":["XCEPT:\n","What percentage of the aluminum in the Earth‘s crust is in the form of bauxite?\n","Are aluminum-bearing nonbauxite minerals plentiful?\n","Do the aluminous minerals found in bauxite contain hydrated oxides?\n","Are aluminous hydrated oxides found in rocks?\n","Do large quantities of bauxite exist?\n"]},{"subject":" The author implies that corundum would be used to produce aluminum if\n","options":["corundum could be found that is not contaminated by silicates\n","the production of alumina could be eliminated as an intermediate step in manufacturing aluminum\n","many large deposits of very high quality corundum were to be discovered\n","new technologies were to make it possible to convert corundum to a silicate\n","manufacturers were to realize that the world‘s supply of bauxite is not unlimited\n\n\f"]}],"answers":["C","A","C"]}
