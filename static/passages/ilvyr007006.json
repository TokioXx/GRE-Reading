{"id":"ilvyr007006","title":"Wuthering Heights中不是所有部分都可以统一的","content":["\n❶Many critics of Emily Bronte‘s novel Wuthering Heights see its second part as a counterpoint that comments\non, if it does not reverse, the first part, where a ―romantic‖ reading receives more confirmation. ❷Seeing the\ntwo parts as a whole is encouraged by the novel‘s sophisticated structure, revealed in its complex use of narrators\nand time shifts. ❸Granted that the presence of these elements need not argue an authorial awareness of\nnovelistic construction comparable to that of Henry James, their presence does encourage attempts to unify the\nnovel‘s heterogeneous parts. ❹However, any interpretation that seeks to unify all of the novel‘s diverse\nelements is bound to be somewhat unconvincing. ❺This is not because such an interpretation necessarily\nstiffens into a thesis (although rigidity in any interpretation of this or of any novel is always a danger), but\nbecause Wuthering Heights has recalcitrant elements of undeniable power that, ultimately, resist inclusion in an\nall-encompassing interpretation. ❻In this respect, Wuthering Heights shares a feature of Hamlet."],"questions":[{"subject":" According to the passage, which of the following is a true statement about the first and second parts of\nWuthering Heights?\n","options":["The second part has received more attention from critics.\n","The second part has little relation to the first part.\n","The second part annuls the force of the first part.\n","The second part provides less substantiation for a ―romantic‖ reading.\n","The second part is better because it is more realistic.\n"]},{"subject":" Which of the following inferences about Henry James‘s awareness of novelistic construction is best\nsupported by the passage?\n","options":["James, more than any other novelist, was aware of the difficulties of novelistic construction.\n","James was very aware of the details of novelistic construction.\n","James‘s awareness of novelistic construction derived from his reading of Bronte.\n","James‘s awareness of novelistic construction has led most commentators to see unity in his individual\nnovels.\n","James‘s awareness of novelistic construction precluded him from violating the unity of his novels.\n"]},{"subject":" The author of the passage would be most likely to agree that an interpretation of a novel should\n","options":["not try to unite heterogeneous elements in the novel\n","not be inflexible in its treatment of the elements in the novel\n","not argue that the complex use of narrators or of time shifts indicates a sophisticated structure\n","concentrate on those recalcitrant elements of the novel that are outside the novel‘s main structure\n","primarily consider those elements of novelistic construction of which the author of the novel was aware\n"]},{"subject":" The author of the passage suggests which of the following about Hamlet?\nI.\n\nHamlet has usually attracted critical interpretations that tend to stiffen into theses.\n\nII.\n\nHamlet has elements that are not amenable to an all-encompassing critical interpretation.\n\nIII.
