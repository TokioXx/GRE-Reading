{"id":"ilvyr002009","title":"真空波动产生虚粒子和真空中引入实粒子产生衰变的必要条件","content":["\n❶Classical physics defines the vacuum as a state of absence: a vacuum is said to exist in a region of space if\nthere is nothing in it. ❷In the quantum field theories that describe the physics of elementary particles, the\nvacuum becomes somewhat more complicated. ❸Even in empty space, particles can appear spontaneously as a\nresult of fluctuations of the vacuum. ❹For example, an electron and a positron, or antielectron, can be created\nout of the void. ❺Particles created in this way have only a fleeting existence; they are annihilated almost as\nsoon as they appear, and their presence can never be detected directly. ❻They are called virtual particles in\norder to distinguish them from real particles, whose lifetimes are not constrained in the same way, and which can\nbe detected. ❼Thus it is still possible to define that vacuum as a space that has no real particles in it.","❶One might expect that the vacuum would always be the state of lowest possible energy for a given region of\nspace. ❷If an area is initially empty and a real particle is put into it, the total energy, it seems, should be raised\nby at least the energy equivalent of the mass of the added particle. ❸A surprising result of some recent\ntheoretical investigations is that this assumption is not invariably true. ❹There are conditions under which the\nintroduction of a real particle of finite mass into an empty region of space can reduce the total energy. ❺If the\nreduction in energy is great enough, an electron and a positron will be spontaneously created. ❻Under these\nconditions the electron and positron are not a result of vacuum fluctuations but are real particles, which exist\nindefinitely and can be detected. ❼In other words, under these conditions the vacuum is an unstable state and\ncan decay into a state of lower energy; i.e., one in which real particles are created.","❶The essential condition for the decay of the vacuum is the presence of an intense electric field. ❷As a result\nof the decay of the vacuum, the space permeated by such a field can be said to acquire an electric charge, and it\ncan be called a charged vacuum. ❸The particles that materialize in the space make the charge manifest. ❹An\nelectric field of sufficient intensity to create a charged vacuum is likely to be found in only one place: in the\nimmediate vicinity of a super heavy atomic nucleus, one with about twice as many protons as the heaviest\nnatural nuclei known. ❺A nucleus that large cannot be stable, but it might be possible to assemble one next to a\nvacuum for long enough to observe the decay of the vacuum. ❻Experiments attempting to achieve this are now\nunder way.","\f17.
