{"id":"ilvyr0010001","title":"个体经营的女性受到的歧视最多","content":["\n❶In a perfectly free and open market economy, the type of employer—government or private—should have\nlittle or no impact on the earnings differentials between women and men. ❷However, if there is discrimination\nagainst one sex, it is unlikely that the degree of discrimination by government and private employers will be the\nsame. ❸Differences in the degree of discrimination would result in earnings differentials associated with the\ntype of employer. ❹Given the nature of government and private employers, it seems most likely that\ndiscrimination by private employers would be greater. ❺Thus, one would expect that, if women are being\ndiscriminated against, government employment would have a positive effect on women‘s earnings as compared\nwith their earnings from private employment. ❻The results of a study by Fuchs support this assumption.\n❼Fuchs‘s results suggest that the earnings of women in an industry composed entirely of government\nemployers would be 14. 6 percent greater than the earnings of women in an industry composed exclusively of\nprivate employees, other things being equal.","❶In addition, both Fuchs and Sanborn have suggested that the effect of discrimination by consumers on the\nearnings of self-employed women may be greater than the effect of either government or private employer\ndiscrimination on the earnings of women employees. ❷To test this hypothesis, Brown selected a large sample\nof White male and female workers from the 1970 Census and divided them into three categories: private\nemployees, government employees, and self-employed. ❸ (Black workers were excluded from the sample to\navoid picking up earnings differentials that were the result of racial disparities.) ❹ Brown‘s research design\ncontrolled for education, labor-force participation, mobility, motivation, and age in order to eliminate these\nfactors as explanations of the study‘s results. ❺Brown‘s results suggest that men and women are not treated the\nsame by employers and consumers. ❻For men, self-employment is the highest earnings category, with private\nemployment next, and government lowest. ❼For women, this order is reversed.","❶One can infer from Brown‘s results that consumers discriminate against self-employed women. ❷In addition,\nself-employed women may have more difficulty than men in getting good employees and may encounter\ndiscrimination from suppliers and from financial institutions.","❶Brown‘s results are clearly consistent with Fuch‘s argument that discrimination by consumers has a greater\nimpact on the earnings of women than does discrimination by either government or private employers. ❷Also,\nthe fact that women do better working for government than for private employers implies that private employers\nare discriminating against women. ❸The results do not prove that government does not discriminate against\nwomen. ❹They do, however, demonstrate that if government is discriminating against women, its\ndiscrimination is not having as much effect on women‘s earnings as is discrimination in the private sector.","\f17.
